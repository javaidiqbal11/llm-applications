It also mentions that the default batch size of 4096 may be too large for datasets with large rows, and provides an example of how to increase the brightness of images using tasks.\n\nTo answer the query, I would suggest using the `batch_format` parameter in the `map_batches` method to specify the desired batch format. If you want to return a dict of NumPy ndarrays, you can set `batch_format=\"numpy\"`. If you want to return a pandas DataFrame, you can set `batch_format=\"pandas\"`.\n\nAdditionally, you can use tasks to transform batches by calling the `map_batches` method with a function that takes a batch as input and returns a transformed batch.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `batch_format` parameter to return a dict of NumPy ndarrays:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Create a dataset\nds = ray.data.from_numpy(np.ones((10, 100)))\n\n# Map batches with a function that takes a batch as input and returns a transformed batch\ndef assert_batch(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    assert len(batch) == 2\n    return batch\n\n# Specify the batch format as \"numpy\"\nds.map_batches(assert_batch, batch_format=\"numpy\", batch_size=2)\n```\nAnd here's an example of how to use tasks to transform batches:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Create a dataset\nds = ray.data.from_numpy(np.ones((10, 100)))\n\n# Define a function that takes a batch as input and returns a transformed batch\ndef increase_brightness(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    batch[\"image\"] = np.clip(batch[\"image\"] + 4, 0, 255)\n    return batch\n\n# Map batches with the function using tasks\nds.map_batches(increase_brightness)\n```",

Spark is a popular open-source data processing engine that is widely used in industry and academia. Ray is a fast, fault-tolerant distributed task execution system that is designed for production workloads. Dask is a Python parallel computing library that provides big data collections that mimic the APIs of familiar NumPy and Pandas libraries, allowing those abstractions to represent larger-than-memory data and/or allowing operations on that data to be run on a multi-machine cluster, while also providing automatic data parallelism and smart scheduling.\n\nIn terms of performance, Ray is generally faster than Dask, but Dask provides more advanced data processing capabilities. Spark is also a popular choice for big data analytics and has a large community of users and developers.\n\nIn terms of use cases, Ray is well-suited for production workloads that require fast, fault-tolerant distributed task execution. Dask is well-suited for data analytics and scientific computing workloads that require big data collections and automatic data parallelism. Spark is well-suited for a wide range of big data analytics and machine learning workloads.\n\nIn terms of interoperability, Ray and Dask can be used together using the Dask-on-Ray scheduler, which allows the entire Dask ecosystem to be executed on top of Ray. Ray also provides APIs for converting datasets to distributed dataframes, including Dask and Spark dataframes.\n\nOverall, the choice of framework depends on the specific use case and requirements of the project.",

This remote process is defined using the `@ray.remote` decorator and is called a parameter server.\n\nIn the provided code, the parameter server is defined as a remote actor using the `ParameterServer` class. The `ParameterServer` class takes the learning rate as an argument in its constructor and initializes the model.\n\nWhen training the model, the workers asynchronously compute the gradients given their current weights and send these gradients to the parameter server as soon as they are ready. The parameter server applies the gradients to its model and sends back a copy of the updated model to the workers. The workers then update their weights and repeat the process.\n\nTo facilitate this, the code imports Ray Train and Ray AIR Session, initializes Ray with `ray.init(ignore_reinit_error=True)`, and creates a parameter server and a list of workers. The workers will asynchronously compute the gradients given their current weights and send these gradients to the parameter server as soon as they are ready. When the parameter server finishes applying the new gradient, it will send back a copy of the current weights to the worker. The worker will then update the weights and repeat.",

The `memory` parameter is used to restrict the heap memory usage of each replica, and the `object_store_memory` parameter is used to restrict the object store memory used per replica when creating objects.\n\nTo determine the appropriate size of memory to use for a specific model, you can refer to the model's documentation or contact the model's authors. They may be able to provide guidance on the appropriate amount of memory to use for inference.\n\nIn general, it's a good idea to start with a relatively small amount of memory and gradually increase it as needed. This can help to avoid running out of memory during inference, which can cause errors or slowdowns.\n\nIf you're using a GPU for inference, you may also want to consider the amount of memory available on the GPU. You can use the `nvidia-smi` command to check the available memory on your GPU.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use the `memory` and `object_store_memory` parameters to restrict the memory usage of a model:\n```\nmodel_id = \"EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B\"\nmemory = 1024  # 1 GB\nobject_store_memory = 512  # 512 MB\n\n# Create a new model instance\nmodel = Model(model_id, memory=memory, object_store_memory=object_store_memory)\n```\nIn this example, we're creating a new model instance with a `memory` parameter of 1024 MB (1 GB) and an `object_store_memory` parameter of 512 MB (512 MB).

Under the hood, Ray Data partitions rows into a set of distributed data blocks, allowing it to perform operations in parallel. Unlike a batch, which is a user-facing object, a block is an internal abstraction.\n\nIn Ray Data, a Dataset operates over a sequence of Ray object references to blocks. Each block contains a disjoint subset of rows, and Ray Data loads and transforms these blocks in parallel. The following figure visualizes a dataset with three blocks, each holding 1000 rows.\n\nThe `ray.data.Dataset.map_batches` and `ray.data.Dataset.iter_batches` methods allow you to perform operations on batches of data in a Dataset.\n\nThe `ray.data.block.BlockAccessor.batch_to_block` method creates a block from user-facing data formats.\n\nIt's important to note that large block size can lead to potential out-of-memory situations, so it's important to make sure no single item in your Ray Data is too large, and always call `ds.map_batches()` with a batch size small enough such that the output batch can comfortably fit into memory.",

Check the Ray documentation for any known issues or limitations related to the `sample` method.\n2. Verify that you are using the `sample` method correctly, according to the documentation.\n3. Check the Ray logs for any error messages or warnings that may indicate the cause of the deadlock.\n4. Try using a different environment or policy to see if the issue is specific to the current environment or policy.\n5. If you are using a custom environment or policy, try using a built-in environment or policy to see if the issue is specific to your custom code.\n6. If you are using a distributed Ray cluster, try running the same code on a single machine to see if the issue is specific to the distributed environment.\n\nIf none of these steps help, you may want to consider posting a more detailed question on the Ray forums or GitHub issue tracker, including a minimal reproducible example of the issue and any relevant error messages or logs.",

You can deploy a fixed-size or autoscaling Ray cluster, depending on your needs.\n\nTo deploy a Ray cluster, you can use the Ray cluster manager, which is a tool that helps you manage your Ray cluster. The Ray cluster manager provides a simple way to deploy, manage, and scale your Ray cluster.\n\nTo use the Ray cluster manager, you can run the following command:\n```\nray cluster create\n```\nThis command will create a new Ray cluster with the default configuration. You can customize the configuration by providing additional options, such as the number of worker nodes, the instance type, and the autoscaling configuration.\n\nOnce the Ray cluster is created, you can run your Ray application on the cluster by using the `ray.init` function to connect to the cluster and the `ray.run` function to run your application on the cluster.\n\nFor example:\n```\nray.init(address=\"ray://<cluster-name>\")\nray.run(my_function)\n```\nThis will run the `my_function` function on the Ray cluster with the specified address.\n\nNote that you need to have the Ray cluster manager installed on your machine to use the `ray cluster create` command. You can install the Ray cluster manager by running the following command:\n```\npip install ray[cluster]\n```",

By default, this will send a KeyboardInterrupt to the task's worker if it is mid-execution. You can also pass in the `force=True` argument to force-exit the worker. Note that currently, Ray will not automatically retry tasks that have been cancelled.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `ray.cancel()` to cancel a task:\n```\n@ray.remote\ndef blocking_operation():\n    time.sleep(10e6)\n\nobj_ref = blocking_operation.remote()\nray.cancel(obj_ref)\n\ntry:\n    ray.get(obj_ref)\nexcept ray.exceptions.TaskCancelledError:\n    print(\"Object reference was cancelled.\")\n```\nNote that if the task has already finished, nothing will happen. Also, only `force=False` is allowed for an Actor Task. Otherwise, it raises `ValueError`. Use `ray.kill(actor)` instead to kill an Actor. Cancelled Tasks aren\u2019t retried. max_task_retries aren\u2019t respected. Calling `ray.get` on a cancelled Task raises a `TaskCancelledError` if the Task has been scheduled or interrupted. Only async actor tasks can be interrupted.\n\nRay attempts to cancel Tasks on a best-effort basis, meaning cancellation isn\u2019t always guaranteed. For example, if the cancellation request doesn\u2019t get through to the executor, the Task might not be cancelled. You can check if a Task was successfully cancelled using `ray.get(actor_task_ref)`.\n\nRay tracks all child and Actor Tasks.

The Redis database is used to store the GCS data, and it is highly available to ensure that the data is not lost if the head node crashes.\n\nTo view the logs of a job run on a Kuberay cluster, you can use the `kubectl describe rayjob` command. This command will provide information about the job, including the history of the job.\n\nTo add external Redis server for GCS fault tolerance, you can add a 1-node Redis cluster to your Kubernetes YAML file. This will provide a highly available Redis database for storing the GCS data.\n\nFor log persistence, you can use a log collection tool such as Fluentd or Filebeat to collect logs from the Ray cluster. These tools can be configured to store the logs in a persistent storage location, such as a cloud storage bucket or a persistent volume.",

This will allow you to scale out the preprocessing to utilize all the resources in your Ray cluster.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use Ray Data to preprocess a dataset of images:\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray.data.preprocessors import MinMaxScaler\nfrom ray.train.xgboost import XGBoostTrainer\nfrom ray.train import ScalingConfig\n\n# Load the dataset\nds = ray.data.read_parquet(\"data.parquet\")\n\n# Preprocess the dataset\ntransformed_ds = ds.map(preprocess_image)\n\n# Train a model on the preprocessed dataset\ntrainer = XGBoostTrainer(num_boost_round=10, scaling_config=ScalingConfig(num_workers=4))\ntrainer.fit(transformed_ds)\n```\nIn this example, the `preprocess_image` function is applied to each image in the dataset using the `map` method. This function should perform the desired preprocessing operations on the image, such as resizing or normalizing the pixel values. The resulting preprocessed dataset is then passed to the `XGBoostTrainer` to train a model on it.\n\nNote that the `map` method is lazy, meaning that it won't perform the preprocessing until the results are consumed.

In this case, the `Model` class is defined with a `__call__()` method that takes a batch of input data and returns the corresponding output.\n\nThe reason for using this naming convention is to make the code more readable and intuitive. By using the `__call__()` method, it is clear that the `Model` class is being used as a function to perform batch inference, and the code is easier to understand and debug.\n\nIn addition, using the `__call__()` method allows for more flexibility and extensibility in the code. For example, the `Model` class could be subclassed to define different types of batch inference, and the `__call__()` method could be overridden to provide different behavior.\n\nOverall, using the `__call__()` method for batch inference in Ray is a common and well-established convention in Python, and it helps to make the code more readable and maintainable.",

            "answer": " Yes, it is possible to load and run inference without using PyTorch or TensorFlow directly. One way to do this is by using a library such as Ray Data, which provides a simple and efficient way to perform batch inference with pre-trained models.\n\nTo perform inference with a pre-trained model using Ray Data, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a Ray Dataset from your data. This can be done by mapping a pre-trained model over your data.\n2. Define a Predictor class for inference. This class should initialize the model just once in `__init__` and re-use it for inference across multiple batches.\n3. Use the Predictor class to perform inference on a batch of data. This can be done by calling the `__call__` method on the Predictor class and passing in the batch of data as an argument.\n\nHere is an example of how to perform inference on a batch of data using Ray Data:\n```\n# Step 1: Create a Ray Dataset from in-memory Numpy arrays.\nds = ray.data.from_numpy(np.ones((1, 100)))\n\n# Step 2: Define a Predictor class for inference.\nclass TorchPredictor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Load a dummy neural network.\n        # Set `self.model` to your pre-trained PyTorch model.\n        self.model = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Linear(in_features=100, out_features=1),\n            nn.Sigmoid(),\n        )\n        self.model.eval()\n\n    def __call__(self, batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n        tensor = torch.as_tensor(batch[\"data\"], dtype=torch.float32)\n        with torch.inference_mode():\n            # Get the predictions from the input batch.\n            return {\"output\": self.model(tensor).numpy()}\n\n# Step 3: Perform inference on a batch of data.\npredictor = TorchPredictor()\nbatch = ds.take(1)\noutput = predictor(batch)\nprint(output)\n```\nThis code will perform inference on a batch of data using the pre-trained PyTorch model and Ray Data. The output will be a dictionary containing the predictions for each sample in the batch.",

            "answer": " To cancel a job from the UI, you can use the `ray.cancel` API. This API cancels a task and sends a `KeyboardInterrupt` to the task's worker by default. You can also force-exit the worker by passing `force=True` to `ray.cancel`.\n\nHere's an example of how to use `ray.cancel` to cancel a job from the UI:\n```\n@ray.remote\ndef cancel(request_id: str) -> None:\n    make_request(\"cancel\", request_id)\n\nif error:\n    return workflow.continuation(\n        wait_all.bind(\n            cancel.bind(car_req_id),\n            cancel.bind(hotel_req_id),\n            cancel.bind(flight_req_id),\n        )\n    )\nelse:\n    return result\n```\nIn this example, the `cancel` function is decorated with `@ray.remote` to make it a remote function. The `cancel` function takes a `request_id` argument, which is used to identify the task to be canceled. The `cancel` function then calls `make_request` to send a request to the Ray cluster to cancel the task.\n\nTo use this function from the UI, you can call `cancel.bind(request_id)` to create a bound version of the `cancel` function that takes no arguments. You can then call this bound function to cancel the task.\n\nFor example:\n```\nworkflow_task = some_job.bind()\nworkflow.run(workflow_task, workflow_id=\"some_job\")\nworkflow.cancel(workflow_id=\"some_job\")\nassert workflow.get_status(\"some_job\") == workflow.CANCELED\n```\nIn this example, the `some_job` function is decorated with `@ray.remote` to make it a remote function. The `some_job` function is then bound to a workflow task using `some_job.bind()`. The workflow task is then run using `workflow.run`, and the workflow is canceled using `workflow.cancel`. Finally, the status of the workflow is checked using `workflow.get_status` to ensure that it has been canceled.",

We then define a `setUp` method that initializes the Ray cluster with 4 CPUs and 0 GPUs.\n\nWe then define a `test_ray_function` method that calls the `ray.task` function with a Python function and an input object. We then assert that the result of the function is equal to the input object.\n\nYou can run this test using the `unittest` module:\n```\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\nThis will run the `test_ray_function` method and print the results.\n\nNote that this is just a simple example, and you may need to modify it to fit your specific use case.

This function takes an optional `filters` parameter that allows you to filter the actors by various criteria, such as their state or the type of task they are running.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `list_actors` function to list all actors in the cluster:\n```\nimport ray\n\nray.init()\n\nactors = ray.util.state.list_actors()\n\nfor actor in actors:\n    print(actor)\n```\nThis will print a list of all actors in the cluster, along with their ID, state, and other information.\n\nYou can also use the `filters` parameter to filter the actors by specific criteria. For example, to list all actors that are currently running, you can use the following code:\n```\nimport ray\n\nray.init()\n\nactors = ray.util.state.list_actors(filters=[(\"state\", \"=\", \"RUNNING\")])\n\nfor actor in actors:\n    print(actor)\n```\nThis will print a list of all actors that are currently running, along with their ID and state.\n\nYou can also use the `limit` parameter to limit the number of actors that are returned. For example, to list the first 10 actors in the cluster, you can use the following code:\n```\nimport ray\n\nray.init()\n\nactors = ray.util.state.list_actors(limit=10)\n\nfor actor in actors:\n    print(actor)\n```\nThis will print a list of the first 10 actors in the cluster, along with their ID and state.\n\nI hope this helps!

Apply the RayCluster CR file to the Kubernetes cluster using the `kubectl apply` command.\n3.

To view the pods for the head node and worker nodes, you can use the `kubectl get pods` command.\n5. To access the Ray cluster, you can use the `ray attach` command to connect to the head node and then use the `ray submit` command to submit jobs to the cluster.\n\nNote that the Ray cluster has fault tolerance enabled by default using the external Redis.

We override the `on_train_epoch_end` method to fetch the metrics, add customized metrics, and report them to Ray Train using the `report` method.\n\nYou can use this custom callback in the same way as the `RayTrainReportCallback`:\n```\ntrainer = Trainer(\n    model=model,\n    args=training_args,\n    train_dataset=small_train_ds,\n    eval_dataset=small_eval_ds,\n    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,\n)\n\n# Add the custom callback\ntrainer.add_callback(MyTrainReportCallback())\n```",

If this port is unavailable when Ray starts, the dashboard agent's HTTP server will fail, but the dashboard agent and Ray will continue to run.

This can cause the Ray cluster to become unresponsive and fail to start new nodes.\n\nTo debug this issue, you can try the following:\n\n1. Check the Ray cluster status using the `ray status` command. This will give you an overview of the cluster's current state, including the number of available CPUs and the status of the nodes.\n2. Check the Ray scheduler logs for any error messages related to resource allocation. You can do this by running `ray logs` and looking for any error messages related to resource allocation.\n3. Check the Ray autoscaler logs for any error messages related to node provisioning. You can do this by running `ray logs` and looking for any error messages related to node provisioning.\n4. Consider reducing the number of actors or Tune trials running on the cluster, as these can consume a significant amount of resources and prevent new nodes from being started.\n5. If you're using a container-based deployment, make sure that the container has enough resources (e.g., CPU, memory) to run the Ray cluster.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify the root cause of the issue and take appropriate action to resolve it.",

If you want to run exit handlers, you can use the `ray.actor.exit_actor()` method to manually terminate the actor.\n\nAlso note that killing an actor will not release any resources that have been allocated to the actor, such as GPUs or memory. You will need to manually release these resources using the appropriate Ray API.",

On a single machine, you can run `ray.init()` without `ray start`, which will both start the Ray cluster services and connect to them.",

            "answer": " The reason why the CPU usage is almost 0% despite the \"running\" status in the Ray tuner is likely due to the fact that the Ray actor is not using any CPU resources.\n\nAccording to the context, Ray actors require 1 CPU when they are scheduled, but after they are created, they occupy 0 CPU. This means that the Ray actor is not using any CPU resources, which could explain why the CPU usage is almost 0%.\n\nIt's also possible that the Ray actor is not using any CPU resources because it is waiting for other tasks to complete. In this case, the CPU usage would be 0% until the other tasks complete and the Ray actor can resume its work.\n\nTo address this issue, you could try limiting the number of concurrent Ray tasks with the `max_concurrent_trials` option in Ray Tune. This can help ensure that there are enough CPU resources available for the Ray actor to run on.",

The file should contain the following environment variables:\n\n* `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST`: This should be set to an address that the head node can use to access Grafana.\n* `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST`: This should be set to an address that the head node can use to access Prometheus.\n* `RAY_PROMETHEUS_NAME`: This should be set to select a different data source to use for the Grafana dashboard panels to use.\n* `RAY_GRAFANA_IFRAME_HOST`: This should be set to an address that the user\u2019s browsers can use to access Grafana and embed visualizations.\n\nFor example, if the IP of the head node is `55.66.77.88` and Grafana is hosted on port `3000`, you can set the `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` environment variable to `http://55.66.77.88:3000`. If all the environment variables are set properly, you should see time-series metrics in Ray Dashboard.\n\nNote that if you use a different Prometheus server for each Ray Cluster and use the same Grafana server for all Clusters, you will need to set the `RAY_PROMETHEUS_NAME` environment variable to different values for each Ray Cluster and add these datasources in Grafana.

If the job does not complete within this time, it will be terminated.\n\nAlternatively, you can set a timeout for the entire Ray cluster by setting the `request_timeout_s` field in the `http_options` field of the Serve config. This will set a timeout for all HTTP requests to the cluster, including job submissions and status checks.\n\nIt's important to note that the timeout only applies to the job itself, and not to the entire Ray cluster.

You can use the `--runtime-env-json` option to specify the runtime environment for the script.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `--runtime-env-json` option:\n```\nserve run --address=ray://<head-node-ip-address>:10001 --runtime-env-json='{\"env_vars\": {\"MY_ENV_VAR\": \"my-value\"}, \"working_dir\": \"./project/src\", \"pip\": [\"requests\", \"chess\"]}' local_dev:graph\n```\nIn this example, the `--runtime-env-json` option is set to a JSON object that specifies the runtime environment for the script. The `env_vars` field sets an environment variable called `MY_ENV_VAR` to the value `my-value`. The `working_dir` field sets the working directory for the script to `./project/src`. The `pip` field specifies the `requests` and `chess` packages to be installed.\n\nWhen you run the script using the `serve run` command, Ray will use the specified runtime environment to run the script.

Insufficient resources: If the cluster is running low on resources, such as CPU or memory, it can lead to spikes in CPU utilization as nodes compete for available resources.\n2. Preprocessing compute time: Adding more CPU-only nodes can parallelize preprocessing, reducing the time it takes to complete and reducing the load on other nodes.\n3. Object store memory: Adding more CPU-only nodes can increase total cluster object store memory, allowing more data to be buffered in between preprocessing and training stages.\n4. Autoscaling: If the cluster is set to autoscale, it can lead to spikes in CPU utilization as nodes are added or removed to match the current workload.",

Increase the size of the object store: If the object store is too small, objects may not get spilled to external storage. You can increase the size of the object store by setting the `--object-store-memory` flag when starting Ray.\n2. Use an SSD: If you are using an HDD, it is recommended to use an SSD instead, as SSDs are faster and can reduce the performance impact of object spilling.\n3. Increase the buffer size: To reduce the number of IO requests during spilling, you can increase the buffer size by setting the `--spill-buffer-size` flag when starting Ray.\n4. Use multiple remote storages: If you have multiple remote storages available, you can configure Ray to spill objects to multiple storages. This can help distribute the load and improve performance.\n5. Monitor object spilling: You can monitor object spilling by using the `ray.object_spilled()` function to check if objects are being spilled to external storage. If you find that objects are not getting spilled, you can try adjusting the above settings to improve performance.",
