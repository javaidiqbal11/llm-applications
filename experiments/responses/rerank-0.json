Use a non-vectorized transformation (e.g., `map`) instead of `map_batches`.\n2. Convert the `pandas` DataFrame to a vectorized format (e.g., a NumPy array) before applying the transformation.\n\nHere's an example of how you can convert the `pandas` DataFrame to a NumPy array:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Convert the pandas DataFrame to a NumPy array\ndata = np.array(df)\n\n# Apply the transformation to the NumPy array\ndata = data.map_batches(lambda x: x + 4, batch_size=2)\n```\nAlternatively, you can use the `ray.data.from_pandas` function to create a `ray.data.Dataset` from the `pandas` DataFrame, and then apply the transformation to the dataset.\n```python\nimport ray.data\n\n# Create a ray.data.Dataset from the pandas DataFrame\nds = ray.data.from_pandas(df)\n\n# Apply the transformation to the dataset\nds = ds.map_batches(lambda x: x + 4, batch_size=2)\n```",

The Ray Serve Autoscaler sits on top of the Ray Autoscaler and asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren't enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes, which the underlying cloud provider will then add. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it tries to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

            "answer": " To scatter actors across a cluster in Ray, you can use the `scheduling_strategy` parameter in the `@ray.remote` decorator. There are several strategies available, including `SPREAD`, `PACK`, and `AUTO`.\n\nThe `SPREAD` strategy will try to spread the actors across available nodes in the cluster. This can be useful when you have a large number of actors and want to distribute them evenly across the cluster.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `SPREAD` strategy to scatter actors across a cluster:\n```\n@ray.remote(scheduling_strategy=\"SPREAD\")\ndef spread_func() -> None:\n    pass\n\n# Spread actors across the cluster.\nactors = [spread_func.remote() for _ in range(10)]\n```\nIn this example, the `spread_func` function is decorated with the `scheduling_strategy=\"SPREAD\"` parameter, which tells Ray to spread the actors across available nodes in the cluster. The `actors` list is then created by calling the `spread_func.remote()` method 10 times, which will create 10 actors that are spread across the cluster.\n\nNote that the `SPREAD` strategy is just one of several strategies available in Ray. You can also use the `PACK` strategy to pack actors into a single node, or the `AUTO` strategy to let Ray automatically choose the best strategy based on the available resources.",

The error message mentions that the worker node received a SIGTERM signal due to memory pressure, which suggests that the node ran out of memory.\n\nTo debug this issue, you can try the following:\n\n1. Check the memory usage on the worker nodes using the `ray logs` command. This will show you the memory usage of each worker node and help you identify which node is running out of memory.\n2. Adjust the `max_calls` parameter in the `ray.remote` decorator to reduce the number of tasks that can be executed on each worker node. This can help prevent the worker nodes from running out of memory.\n3. Provision more memory on the worker nodes or reduce the task parallelism by requesting more CPUs per task. This can help ensure that each worker node has enough memory to complete its tasks.\n4. Consider disabling worker killing by setting the `RAY_memory_monitor_refresh_ms` environment variable to zero. This can help prevent the worker nodes from being killed due to memory pressure, but it may also lead to other issues such as increased memory usage.\n\nBy taking these steps, you should be able to debug the issue and prevent the worker nodes from running out of memory.",

Use the `ray.rllib.evaluation.rollout_worker.RolloutWorker.lock()` method to lock the rollout worker and prevent other threads from accessing it while you are debugging.\n3. Use the `ray.rllib.evaluation.sampler.SyncSampler` class to synchronize the sampling process and ensure that only one thread is accessing the rollout worker at a time.\n4. Check the `ray.rllib.evaluation.collectors.sample_collector.SampleCollector` class to ensure that it is properly configured and that it is not causing any issues with the sampling process.\n5. Check the `ray.rllib.algorithms.pg.pg_tf_policy.PGTF1Policy` class to ensure that it is properly configured and that it is not causing any issues with the sampling process.\n6. Check the `gymnasium` library to ensure that it is properly installed and that it is not causing any issues with the sampling process.\n7.

This will allow the remote function to access the numpy array without making a copy.\n\nHere's an example:\n```\nimport ray\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create a numpy array\narr = np.zeros(100)\n\n# Store the numpy array in the object store\narr_id = ray.put(arr)\n\n# Pass the ID of the stored array to the remote function\n@ray.remote\ndef f(arr_id):\n    # Get the numpy array from the object store\n    arr = ray.get(arr_id)\n    # Modify the numpy array\n    arr[0] = 1\n    return arr\n\n# Call the remote function with the ID of the stored array\nresult = f.remote(arr_id)\n\n# Get the result from the object store\nresult = ray.get(result)\n```\nIn this example, the `ray.put()` function is used to store the numpy array `arr` in the object store, and the ID of the stored array is passed to the remote function `f`. The remote function `f` retrieves the numpy array from the object store using the ID, modifies it, and returns the modified array. The result is then retrieved from the object store using the `ray.get()` function.\n\nNote that the `ray.put()` function is only necessary when you want to store the numpy array in the object store and pass the ID to the remote function. If you simply want to pass the numpy array as an argument to the remote function, you can do so directly without using `ray.put()`.",

Garbage collection: The actor will still be garbage-collected if no handles to it exist, so you don't need to worry about managing the actor's lifetime.\n4. Actor-based approach: Using a named actor can be more efficient than using tasks, as it reuses model initialization for many tasks, so the node will spend more time on the actual workload.\n5. Flexible scheduling: Tasks are scheduled more flexibly when using named actors, and you can use both detached and non-detached actors.\n6. Resource utilization: Named actors can maximize the time that workers are working, and you can allocate enough cluster resources to maximize resource utilization.\n7. Easy retrieval of stateful actors: You can easily retrieve the state of a named actor, which can be useful if you need to access the state of an actor that was launched by another driver.",

The trial will be retried until it succeeds or the maximum number of retries is reached.\n\nYou can also use the `Tune.with_resources` method to specify the resources for the trial and the `Tune.Tuner` class to define the trial space.\n\nHere is an example:\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray.tune import Tune\n\n# Define the trial function\ndef trial_fn(config):\n    # Your trial code here\n    pass\n\n# Define the trial space\ntrial_space = {\n    \"param1\": tune.choice([1, 2, 3]),\n    \"param2\": tune.choice([4, 5, 6])\n}\n\n# Run the trial with Tune\ntuner = Tune.Tuner(trial_fn, trial_space)\ntuner.fit()\n```\nThis will run the trial with the specified configuration and retry it if it fails.

This can happen if the function is too complex or if it contains large objects that cannot be serialized.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can try the following:\n\n1. Simplify the function: Try to simplify the function by reducing its complexity or removing any unnecessary parts. This can help reduce the size of the function and make it easier to serialize.\n2. Use a smaller actor: If the function is too large to be serialized, you may need to use a smaller actor. You can do this by creating a new actor with a smaller memory limit using the `options` method. For example:\n```\nactor = Actor.options(memory=1000 * 1024 * 1024).remote()\n```\nThis will create a new actor with a memory limit of 1GB.\n\n3. Use a different serialization method: If the function is still too large to be serialized, you may need to use a different serialization method. For example, you can use the `pickle` module to serialize the function instead of the default `ray` serialization method.\n```\nimport pickle\n\n# Serialize the function using pickle\nserialized_fn = pickle.dumps(fn)\n\n# Deserialize the function using pickle\ndeserialized_fn = pickle.loads(serialized_fn)\n```\nThis will serialize the function using the `pickle` module instead of the default `ray` serialization method.\n\n4. Use a different actor pool: If the function is still too large to be serialized, you may need to use a different actor pool. For example, you can use the `ray.util.actor_pool.ActorPool` class to create an actor pool with a larger memory limit.\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray.util.actor_pool import ActorPool\n\n# Create an actor pool with a larger memory limit\nactor_pool = ActorPool(num_actors=4, memory=1000 * 1024 * 1024)\n\n# Create an actor using the actor pool\nactor = actor_pool.create_actor(fn)\n```\nThis will create an actor pool with a memory limit of 1GB and create an actor using the `fn` function.\n\nBy trying these different approaches, you should be able to resolve the \"The actor ImplicitFunc is too large\" error and successfully create an actor with a large function.",

This allows you to scale out the preprocessing to utilize all the resources in your Ray cluster.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use Ray Data to preprocess a dataset of images:\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray.data.preprocessors import MinMaxScaler\nfrom ray.train.xgboost import XGBoostTrainer\nfrom ray.train import ScalingConfig\n\n# Load the dataset\nds = ray.data.read_parquet(\"data.parquet\")\n\n# Preprocess the data\ntransformed_ds = ds.map(preprocess_image)\n\n# Train the model\ntrainer = XGBoostTrainer(num_workers=4, scaling_config=ScalingConfig(use_gpu=True))\ntrainer.fit(transformed_ds)\n```\nIn this example, the `preprocess_image` function is applied to each image in the dataset using the `map` method. This function can perform any preprocessing operations that you want to apply to the data, such as resizing the images or normalizing the pixel values.\n\nOnce the data has been preprocessed, you can use the `fit` method of the `XGBoostTrainer` to train the model on the preprocessed data.\n\nNote that if the preprocessed data is small enough to fit in Ray object store memory (by default this is 30% of total cluster RAM), you can materialize the preprocessed dataset in Ray\u2019s built-in object store by calling `materialize()` on the preprocessed dataset. This method tells Ray Data to compute the entire preprocessed dataset and pin it in the Ray object store memory. As a result, when iterating over the dataset repeatedly, the preprocessing operations do not need to be re-run.",

It suggests using the `ray.util.inspect_serializability` function to identify the tricky pickling issues. The context also mentions that Ray has decided to use a customized Pickle protocol version 5 backport to replace the original PyArrow serializer, which gets rid of several previous limitations.\n\nThe known issues section mentions that users could experience memory leak when using certain python3.8 & 3.9 versions, which is due to a bug in python\u2019s pickle module. This issue has been solved for Python 3.8.2rc1, Python 3.9.0 alpha 4 or late versions.\n\nTo resolve the issue, you can try to customize the serialization process by defining the `__reduce__` method for the type of objects that are causing the issue.

In this case, the function is used to perform batch inference on a dataset, and the `__call__()` method is used to define the logic for this operation.\n\nThe `__call__()` method takes a batch of data items, instead of a single one. In this case, the batch is also a dict that has the \"transformed_image\" key populated by our preprocessing step, and the value is a Numpy array of images represented in np.ndarray format. We reuse the same inferencing logic from step 2.\n\nThe reason for using the `__call__()` method is to make the code more readable and easier to understand. It allows us to define a function that can be used to perform batch inference on a dataset, and it makes the code more modular and reusable.",

This method takes a list of actor handles as input and performs the all-reduce operation on the data stored in the actors' buffers.\n\nHere is an example of how to perform an all-reduce operation among a list of actors using Ray:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Create two actors\nA = Worker.remote()\nB = Worker.remote()\n\n# Put A and B in a collective group\ncol.declare_collective_group([A, B], options={rank=[0, 1], ...})\n\n# Let A send a message to B\nray.get([A.do_send.remote(target_rank=1), B.do_recv.remote(src_rank=0)])\n\n# Perform the all-reduce operation\ncol.allreduce(A.buffer)\n```\nIn this example, `A` and `B` are two actors that are put in a collective group using the `col.declare_collective_group()` method. The `col.allreduce()` method is then called on the buffer of `A` to perform the all-reduce operation. The result of the all-reduce operation is stored in the buffer of `A`.\n\nNote that the `col.allreduce()` method is a blocking operation, meaning that it will wait for all actors in the collective group to complete the operation before returning.",

We then call the function using `my_function.remote(1)` and assert that the result is `2`.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.task` function to test Ray tasks. Here's an example:\n```\nimport unittest\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n\n    def test_ray_task(self):\n        # Define a Ray task\n        @ray.task\n        def my_task(x):\n            return x + 1\n\n        # Call the Ray task\n        result = my_task.remote(1)\n\n        # Assert that the result is correct\n        assert result == 2\n```\nIn this example, we define a Ray task `my_task` that takes an integer `x` and returns `x + 1`. We then call the task using `my_task.remote(1)` and assert that the result is `2`.\n\nNote that these are just examples, and you will need to modify them to fit your specific use case.

Install the required packages: `pip install \"ray[serve]\" requests torch diffusers==0.12.1 transformers`\n2. Save the following code to a file named `stable_diffusion.py`:\n```python\nfrom io import BytesIO\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\nfrom fastapi.responses import Response\n\n@serve.deployment(\n    ray_actor_options={\"num_gpus\": 1},\n    autoscaling_config={\"min_replicas\": 0, \"max_replicas\": 2},\n)\nclass StableDiffusionV2:\n    def __init__(self):\n        from diffusers import EulerDiscreteScheduler, StableDiffusionPipeline\n\n        model_id = \"stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2\"\n\nentrypoint = APIIngress.bind(StableDiffusionV2.bind())\n```\n3. Use `serve run stable_diffusion:entrypoint` to start the serve application.\n\nNote: The autoscaling config sets `min_replicas` to 0, which means the deployment starts with no ObjectDetection replicas. These replicas spawn only when a request arrives. When no requests arrive after a certain period, Serve downscales ObjectDetection back to 0 replica to save GPU resources.\n\nThese messages are expected in the output:\n\n* `INFO:root:Starting Ray Serve application with 0 replicas.`\n* `INFO:root:Starting Ray Serve application with 1 replicas.`\n* `INFO:root:Starting Ray Serve application with 2 replicas.`\n* `INFO:root:Starting Ray Serve application with 0 replicas.`\n\nYou can develop Ray Serve on your laptop, deploy it on a dev box, and scale it out to multiple machines or a Kubernetes cluster, all with minimal or no changes to code. It\u2019s a lot easier to get started with when you don\u2019t need to provision and manage a K8s cluster. When it\u2019s time to deploy, you can use our Kubernetes Operator to transparently deploy your Ray Serve application to K8s.",

With Ray, every remote operation is asynchronous, meaning it returns a promise/future that represents the result of the operation. The programmer can then use `ray.get()` to retrieve the actual results, which blocks until the results are available. Ray also integrates with popular async frameworks like `aiohttp` and `aioredis`.\n\nTo define an async actor in Ray, the `async` keyword is used before the method definition. Ray will automatically detect whether an actor supports async calls or not.\n\nWhen running async actor tasks, Ray seeks to cancel the associated `asyncio.Task` when the task is interrupted. This cancellation approach aligns with the standards presented in `asyncio` task cancellation. Note that `asyncio.Task` won\u2019t be interrupted in the middle of execution if you don\u2019t `await` within the async function.\n\nIn summary, Ray supports async.io by using the `asyncio` module and integrating with popular async frameworks. Async actors are defined using the `async` keyword before the method definition, and Ray seeks to cancel the associated `asyncio.Task` when the task is interrupted.",

Check if the remote function is running: Use the `ray.get()` method to retrieve the result of the remote function. If the function is still running, `ray.get()` will block until the result is available.\n2. Check if the object reference is valid: Make sure that the object reference passed to `ray.get()` is valid and corresponds to a remote function that has been executed.\n3. Check if the remote function has completed: If the remote function has completed, `ray.get()` should return the result immediately. If the function has not completed, `ray.get()` will block until the result is available.\n4. Check if there are any errors: If there are any errors in the remote function, `ray.get()` may block indefinitely. Check the logs for any error messages.\n5. Check if the object reference is still valid: If the object reference passed to `ray.get()` is no longer valid, `ray.get()` may block indefinitely. Make sure that the object reference is still valid and corresponds to a remote function that has been executed.\n6. Check if there are any deadlocks: If there are any deadlocks in the Ray system, `ray.get()` may block indefinitely. Check the logs for any deadlock messages.\n7. Check if there are any issues with the Ray cluster: If there are any issues with the Ray cluster, such as a lack of resources or a misconfigured cluster, `ray.get()` may block indefinitely. Check the logs for any cluster-related issues.\n\nIn general, it's best to avoid calling `ray.get()` in a loop, as it can harm parallelism.

Here's an example:\n```\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Basic config automatically configures logs to\n        # stream to stdout and stderr.\n        # Set the severity to INFO so that info logs are printed to stdout.\n        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n\n    def log(self, msg):\n        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n        logger.info(msg)\n\nactor = Actor.remote()\nray.get(actor.log.remote(\"A log message for an actor.\"))\n```\nIn this example, we define an actor class `Actor` with a `log` method that uses the `logging` module to log a message. We then create an instance of the actor using `Actor.remote()` and call the `log` method on it using `ray.get(actor.log.remote(\"A log message for an actor.\"))`. The log message will be printed to stdout.\n\nYou can also customize the prefixes for Actor logs by defining the `__repr__` method for the Actor class. For example:\n```\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Every memory allocation after `__enter__` method will be tracked.\n        memray.Tracker(\n            \"/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/\"\n            f\"{ray.get_runtime_context().get_actor_id()}_mem_profile.bin\"\n        ).__enter__()\n        self.arr = [bytearray(b\"1\" * 1000000)]\n\n    def append(self):\n        self.arr.append(bytearray(b\"1\" * 1000000))\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"Actor {self.arr}\"\n\na = Actor.remote()\nray.get(a.append.remote())\n```\nIn this example, we define an actor class `Actor` with a `__repr__` method that returns a string representation of the actor. We then create an instance of the actor using `Actor.remote()` and call the `append` method on it using `ray.get(a.append.remote())`. The `__repr__` method will be called to generate a string representation of the actor, which will be included in the log message.",

Use the `map_batches` method to perform inference on the preprocessed data in parallel across multiple GPU workers.\n\nHere's an example code snippet that demonstrates this process:\n```python\nimport ray\nfrom ray.data import read_text\nfrom ray.data.dataset import Dataset\nfrom ray.data.batch_infer import BatchInferModel\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\n# Load the text data from the S3 bucket\nds = read_text(\"s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/this.txt\")\n\n# Preprocess the text data using a custom callable class\nclass TextClassifier(BatchInferModel):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.model = pipeline(\"text-classification\")\n\n    def __call__(self, batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, list]:\n        predictions = self.model(list(batch[\"data\"]), max_length=20, num_return_sequences=1)\n        return {\n            \"predictions\": [prediction[\"generated_text\"] for prediction in predictions]\n        }\n\n# Perform batch inference on the preprocessed data\nds = ds.map_batches(TextClassifier, compute=ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy(size=2))\n```\nIn this example, we first load the text data from the S3 bucket using the `read_text` method. We then preprocess the text data using a custom callable class `TextClassifier` that sets up and invokes the GPT-2 model. Finally, we use the `map_batches` method to perform inference on the preprocessed data in parallel across multiple GPU workers.\n\nNote that this code snippet assumes that you have already installed the necessary dependencies, such as the `transformers` library, and that you have set up your AWS credentials to access the S3 bucket.",

This can be useful if you want to run tasks that do not require CPU resources, such as tasks that only perform I/O operations.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that setting `num_cpus=0` does not prevent tasks from using CPU resources if they are available. For example, if a task is executed on a machine with 4 CPUs and `num_cpus=0`, the task may still use up to 4 CPUs if the operating system schedules it to do so.\n\nIn general, it's recommended to set `num_cpus` to a non-zero value to ensure that tasks are scheduled and executed correctly. If you do not need to use CPU resources, you can set `num_cpus=1` to ensure that the task is executed on a machine with at least 1 CPU.",

This function takes two arguments: `num_cpus` and `bundles`. `num_cpus` specifies the number of CPUs to request, and `bundles` specifies the number of bundles to request.\n\nHere's an example of how to use this function to scale up a cluster to a total of 3 CPUs:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Connect to the Ray cluster\nray.init(\"ray://<head_node_host>:<port>\")\n\n# Request 3 CPUs\nray.autoscaler.sdk.request_resources(num_cpus=3)\n```\nThis will request 3 CPUs from the Ray cluster, and the cluster will immediately attempt to scale up to accommodate the requested resources.\n\nNote that the `ray.autoscaler.sdk.request_resources()` function can also be used to request other resources, such as GPUs or memory, by specifying the appropriate `bundles` argument. For example, to request 3 GPUs, you can use the following code:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Connect to the Ray cluster\nray.init(\"ray://<head_node_host>:<port>\")\n\n# Request 3 GPUs\nray.autoscaler.sdk.request_resources(bundles=[{\"GPU\": 3}])\n```\nThis will request 3 GPUs from the Ray cluster, and the cluster will immediately attempt to scale up to accommodate the requested resources.",

You can specify multiple subnets by separating them with commas.\n\nNote that the `subnets` field is only available in the `provider` section of the configuration file, and it is not available in the `cluster` section.

The GCS server is taking up a lot of memory on the head node because it is storing a large amount of metadata, which is necessary for the proper functioning of the Ray cluster.\n\nTo address this issue, you can try increasing the memory available to the head node, or you can use an external Redis instance as a data store for the Ray head, which can help to reduce the memory usage of the GCS server. Additionally, you can check the Ray Serve documentation for more information on how to set up external Redis for fault tolerance.",

Check the Ray cluster logs to see if there are any error messages related to the pending nodes. You can use the `ray logs` command to view the logs.\n3. Check the system settings on the nodes to ensure that they are properly configured for communication. You can use the `ray system-config` command to view the system settings.\n4. Check the network connectivity between the nodes to ensure that they can communicate with each other. You can use the `ray network-status` command to view the network status.\n5.

Export logs and metrics to your observability platforms: For production deployments, it is recommended to export logs and metrics to your observability platforms. This can help you monitor your application's performance and identify issues more effectively.",

This exception is thrown when Ray encounters a system error, such as when the raylet is killed. You can use this exception to catch and handle uncaught exceptions in your Ray Serve application.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use the `RaySystemError` exception to track uncaught exceptions in Ray Serve:\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray import serve\n\n@serve.deployment\ndef my_deployment(request):\n    try:\n        # Your deployment code here\n    except ray.exceptions.RaySystemError as e:\n        # Handle the exception here\n        print(f\"RaySystemError: {e}\")\n```\nIn this example, the `my_deployment` function is decorated with the `@serve.deployment` decorator to indicate that it is a Ray Serve deployment. The function contains a `try` block that contains the deployment code, and a `except` block that catches any `RaySystemError` exceptions that are thrown. The `except` block prints the exception message to the console.\n\nBy using the `RaySystemError` exception to catch uncaught exceptions in your Ray Serve application, you can handle errors and faults that may occur during the execution of your application.",

The `ray logs` command allows you to view logs from the cluster, and you can filter the logs by node ID or log file name.\n\nTo view the logs for a specific node, you can use the `--node-id` or `--node-ip` flag followed by the node ID or IP address. For example:\n```\nray logs --node-id <NODE_ID>\n```\nTo view the logs for a specific log file, you can use the `--filename` flag followed by the log file name. For example:\n```\nray logs --filename <LOG_FILE_NAME>\n```\nYou can also use the `--follow` flag to stream the logs in real-time.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `ray.util.state.get_log()` function in the Python SDK to retrieve the logs programmatically. This function takes the node ID or IP address and the log file name as arguments, and returns an iterator over the log lines. For example:\n```\nfrom ray.util.state import get_log\n\nfor line in get_log(filename=\"gcs_server.out\", node_id=<NODE_ID>):\n    print(line)\n```\nNote that the `ray logs` command and the `get_log()` function only work for logs that are emitted by the Ray Serve endpoint, and not for other logs that may be emitted by the Ray cluster.",

This method takes a list of sorted integers as input, which indicate where the dataset should be split. The method returns the dataset splits.\n\nFor example, if you have a Ray Dataset `ds` and you want to split it into two parts, you can use the following code:\n```\nd1, d2 = ds.split_at_indices([2])\n```\nThis will split the dataset into two parts, with the first part containing the first two rows and the second part containing the remaining rows.\n\nYou can also use the `take_batch()` method to take a subset of rows from a Ray Dataset. This method takes a single integer as input, which indicates the number of rows to take. For example:\n```\nrows = ds.take_batch(5)\n```\nThis will take the first five rows from the dataset and return them as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row.\n\nNote that the `split_at_indices()` method is more flexible than `take_batch()`, as it allows you to specify the exact indices at which to split the dataset. However, `take_batch()` can be more convenient for simple use cases where you just want to take a fixed number of rows from the dataset.",

We then use the `get_checkpoints` method to retrieve all checkpoints for the experiment. Finally, we print the checkpoints to the console.\n\nNote that the `resume_errored` argument is set to `True` to indicate that the experiment should be resumed even if there were errors during the previous run.

The `map_batches` method applies this function to each batch in the dataset.\n\nThe `batch_format` parameter can be used to specify the format of the batches.

Set `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST` to the IP address of the head node followed by the port number that Prometheus is running on (e.g. `http://<head_node_ip>:9090`).\n\nFor example, if the IP address of the head node is `55.66.77.88` and Grafana is running on port `3000`, you can set `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` to `http://55.66.77.88:3000`. Similarly, if Prometheus is running on port `9090`, you can set `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST` to `http://55.66.77.88:9090`.\n\nIf you are using KubeRay, you can also set `RAY_GRAFANA_IFRAME_HOST` to the external URL of the Grafana ingress. This will allow the dashboard to embed visualizations from Grafana.\n\nNote that if you are using a different Prometheus server for each Ray Cluster and using the same Grafana server for all Clusters, you can set the `RAY_PROMETHEUS_NAME` environment variable to different values for each Ray Cluster and add these datasources in Grafana.",

The script requires a specific version of a package called `my_package` to be installed. You can use the `--runtime-env-json` option to specify the package version and other dependencies for the script.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `--runtime-env-json` option:\n```\nray submit --runtime-env-json '{\"working_dir\": \"https://github.com/example_username/example_repository/archive/HEAD.zip\"}' my_script.py\n```\nIn this example, the `--runtime-env-json` option specifies that the script should be run in a runtime environment that includes the `my_package` package at the specified version. The `working_dir` field specifies the location of the package archive.\n\nYou can also use the `--runtime-env-json` option to specify other dependencies for the script, such as Python modules or environment variables. For example:\n```\nray submit --runtime-env-json '{\"working_dir\": \"https://github.com/example_username/example_repository/archive/HEAD.zip\", \"py_modules\": [\"my_module\"]}' my_script.py\n```\nIn this example, the `--runtime-env-json` option specifies that the script should be run in a runtime environment that includes the `my_module` Python module.

Insufficient network bandwidth on the head node, which can cause bottlenecks and spikes in CPU utilization.\n4.

Check the GCS server logs to see if there are any errors related to the connection failure.\n2. Make sure that the worker node is accessible from the head node, and that there are no firewall settings preventing access.\n3. Check the version of Ray running on the head node and ensure that it matches the version running on the worker node.\n4. If the connection fails, you can use a tool such as nmap or nc to check whether each port can be reached from the worker node.\n5. If you are using GCS fault tolerance, ensure that the ray.io/external-storage-namespace annotation is unique for each RayCluster custom resource.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, you may need to provide more information about your Ray cluster configuration and the specific error messages you are seeing in order to troubleshoot the problem further.",

You can obtain the replica handle by using the `ray.get_actor` function and passing in the replica's name and namespace.\n\nHere's an example of how you can kill a specific serve replica:\n```\n>>> import ray\n>>> replica_handle = ray.get_actor(\"SERVE_REPLICA::SleepyPid#RlRptP\", namespace=\"serve\")\n>>> ray.kill(replica_handle, no_restart=True)\n```\nIn this example, the replica handle is obtained using the `ray.get_actor` function, and then the `ray.kill` function is used to kill the replica. The `no_restart` argument is set to `True` to prevent the replica from being restarted.\n\nNote that killing a replica will cause the replica to be removed from the deployment, and any requests that were being processed by the replica will be lost. If you want to simulate a replica failure without losing requests, you can use the `ray.kill` function with the `no_restart` argument set to `False`. This will cause the replica to be restarted, and any requests that were being processed by the replica will be re-routed to the new replica.",
