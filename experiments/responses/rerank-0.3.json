Use a non-vectorized transformation (e.g., `map`) instead of `map_batches`.\n2. Convert the `pandas` DataFrame to a vectorized format (e.g., a NumPy array) before applying the transformation.\n\nHere's an example of how you can convert the `pandas` DataFrame to a NumPy array:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Convert the pandas DataFrame to a NumPy array\ndata = np.array(df)\n\n# Apply the transformation to the NumPy array\ndata = data.map_batches(lambda x: x + 4, batch_size=2)\n```\nAlternatively, you can use the `ray.data.from_pandas` function to create a `ray.data.Dataset` from the `pandas` DataFrame, and then apply the transformation to the dataset.\n```python\nimport ray.data\n\n# Create a ray.data.Dataset from the pandas DataFrame\nds = ray.data.from_pandas(df)\n\n# Apply the transformation to the dataset\nds = ds.map_batches(lambda x: x + 4, batch_size=2)\n```",

The Ray Serve Autoscaler sits on top of the Ray Autoscaler and asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren't enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes, which the underlying cloud provider will then add. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it tries to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

            "answer": " To scatter actors across a cluster in Ray, you can use the `scheduling_strategy` parameter in the `@ray.remote` decorator. There are several strategies available, including `SPREAD`, `PACK`, and `AUTO`.\n\nThe `SPREAD` strategy will try to spread the actors across available nodes in the cluster. This can be useful when you have a large number of actors and want to distribute them evenly across the cluster.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `SPREAD` strategy to scatter actors across a cluster:\n```\n@ray.remote(scheduling_strategy=\"SPREAD\")\ndef spread_func() -> None:\n    pass\n\n# Spread actors across the cluster.\nactors = [spread_func.remote() for _ in range(10)]\n```\nIn this example, the `spread_func` function is decorated with the `scheduling_strategy=\"SPREAD\"` parameter, which tells Ray to spread the actors across available nodes in the cluster. The `actors` list is then created by calling the `spread_func.remote()` method 10 times, which will create 10 actors that are spread across the cluster.\n\nNote that the `SPREAD` strategy is just one of several strategies available in Ray. You can also use the `PACK` strategy to pack actors into a single node, or the `AUTO` strategy to let Ray automatically choose the best strategy based on the available resources.",

Here's an example of how to use it:\n```python\nimport ray\nfrom ray.tune.logger import TensorBoardLogger\n\n# Define the TensorBoardLogger\ntensorboard_logger = TensorBoardLogger(\n    name=\"my_experiment\",\n    save_dir=\"~/ray_results/tensorboard\",\n    version=\".\"\n)\n\n# Define the training function\ndef train_func():\n    # ...\n    # Log the results to TensorBoard\n    tensorboard_logger.log_metrics(\n        metrics={\n            \"loss\": \"ptl/val_loss\",\n            \"mean_accuracy\": \"ptl/val_accuracy\"\n        },\n        step=0\n    )\n    # ...\n\n# Run the training function\nray.init()\nray.get(train_func.remote())\n```\nIn this example, the `TensorBoardLogger` is defined with the name of the experiment, the directory where the results will be saved, and the version of the experiment. The `log_metrics` method is used to log the metrics to TensorBoard.",

PACK is a best-effort strategy, meaning that if not all bundles can be packed into a single node, they will be placed on separate nodes. SPREAD, on the other hand, is a strict strategy, meaning that each bundle must be scheduled in a separate node.",

The `ray.get()` function returns a copy of the NumPy ndarray, so you can modify the array without affecting the original data.\n\nNote that the `to_numpy_refs()` method only works for datasets that can be converted to NumPy ndarrays.

Garbage collection: The actor will still be garbage-collected if no handles to it exist, so you don't need to worry about managing the actor's lifetime.\n4. Actor-based approach: Using a named actor can be more efficient than using tasks, as it reuses model initialization for many tasks, so the node will spend more time on the actual workload.\n5. Flexible scheduling: Tasks are scheduled more flexibly when using named actors, and you can use both detached and non-detached actors.\n6. Resource utilization: Named actors can maximize the time that workers are working, and you can allocate enough cluster resources to maximize resource utilization.\n7. Easy retrieval of stateful actors: You can easily retrieve the state of a named actor, which can be useful if you need to access the state of an actor that was launched by another driver.",

This can happen if the function is too complex or if it contains large objects that cannot be serialized.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can try the following:\n\n1. Simplify the function: Try to simplify the function by reducing its complexity or removing any unnecessary parts. This can help reduce the size of the function and make it easier to serialize.\n2. Use a smaller actor: If the function is too large to be serialized, you may need to use a smaller actor. You can do this by creating a new actor with a smaller memory limit using the `options` method. For example:\n```\nactor = Actor.options(memory=1000 * 1024 * 1024).remote()\n```\nThis will create a new actor with a memory limit of 1GB.\n\n3. Use a different serialization method: If the function is still too large to be serialized, you may need to use a different serialization method. For example, you can use the `pickle` module to serialize the function instead of the default `ray` serialization method.\n```\nimport pickle\n\n# Serialize the function using pickle\nserialized_fn = pickle.dumps(fn)\n\n# Deserialize the function using pickle\ndeserialized_fn = pickle.loads(serialized_fn)\n```\nThis will serialize the function using the `pickle` module instead of the default `ray` serialization method.\n\n4. Use a different actor pool: If the function is still too large to be serialized, you may need to use a different actor pool. For example, you can use the `ray.util.actor_pool.ActorPool` class to create an actor pool with a larger memory limit.\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray.util.actor_pool import ActorPool\n\n# Create an actor pool with a larger memory limit\nactor_pool = ActorPool(num_actors=4, memory=1000 * 1024 * 1024)\n\n# Create an actor using the actor pool\nactor = actor_pool.create_actor(fn)\n```\nThis will create an actor pool with a memory limit of 1GB and create an actor using the `fn` function.\n\nBy trying these different approaches, you should be able to resolve the \"The actor ImplicitFunc is too large\" error and successfully create an actor with a large function.",

This allows you to scale out the preprocessing to utilize all the resources in your Ray cluster.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use Ray Data to preprocess a dataset of images:\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray.data.preprocessors import MinMaxScaler\nfrom ray.train.xgboost import XGBoostTrainer\nfrom ray.train import ScalingConfig\n\n# Load the dataset\nds = ray.data.read_parquet(\"data.parquet\")\n\n# Preprocess the data\ntransformed_ds = ds.map(preprocess_image)\n\n# Train the model\ntrainer = XGBoostTrainer(num_workers=4, scaling_config=ScalingConfig(use_gpu=True))\ntrainer.fit(transformed_ds)\n```\nIn this example, the `preprocess_image` function is applied to each image in the dataset using the `map` method. This function can perform any preprocessing operations that you want to apply to the data, such as resizing the images or normalizing the pixel values.\n\nOnce the data has been preprocessed, you can use the `fit` method of the `XGBoostTrainer` to train the model on the preprocessed data.\n\nNote that if the preprocessed data is small enough to fit in Ray object store memory (by default this is 30% of total cluster RAM), you can materialize the preprocessed dataset in Ray\u2019s built-in object store by calling `materialize()` on the preprocessed dataset. This method tells Ray Data to compute the entire preprocessed dataset and pin it in the Ray object store memory. As a result, when iterating over the dataset repeatedly, the preprocessing operations do not need to be re-run.",

This is likely due to the use of a customized serialization process that is not compatible with the default serializer used by Ray (pickle5 + cloudpickle).\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can try using a different serialization method, such as using the `dill` library to serialize the object. Alternatively, you can try using the `ray.util.inspect_serializability` function to identify the tricky pickling issues and fix them.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the error message suggests that you may have a recursive object, which can be difficult to serialize. In such cases, you may need to use a different serialization method or modify the object to make it serializable.",

In this case, the function is used to perform batch inference on a dataset, and the `__call__()` method is used to define the logic for this operation.\n\nThe `__call__()` method takes a batch of data items, instead of a single one. In this case, the batch is also a dict that has the \"transformed_image\" key populated by our preprocessing step, and the value is a Numpy array of images represented in np.ndarray format. We reuse the same inferencing logic from step 2.\n\nThe reason for using the `__call__()` method is to make the code more readable and easier to understand. It allows us to define a function that can be used to perform batch inference on a dataset, and it makes the code more modular and reusable.",

This method takes a list of actor handles as input and performs the all-reduce operation on the data stored in the actors' buffers.\n\nHere is an example of how to perform an all-reduce operation among a list of actors using Ray:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Create two actors\nA = Worker.remote()\nB = Worker.remote()\n\n# Put A and B in a collective group\ncol.declare_collective_group([A, B], options={rank=[0, 1], ...})\n\n# Let A send a message to B\nray.get([A.do_send.remote(target_rank=1), B.do_recv.remote(src_rank=0)])\n\n# Perform the all-reduce operation\ncol.allreduce(A.buffer)\n```\nIn this example, `A` and `B` are two actors that are put in a collective group using the `col.declare_collective_group()` method. The `col.allreduce()` method is then called on the buffer of `A` to perform the all-reduce operation. The result of the all-reduce operation is stored in the buffer of `A`.\n\nNote that the `col.allreduce()` method is a blocking operation, meaning that it will wait for all actors in the collective group to complete the operation before returning.",

Here's an example of how to write a unit test for a Ray function:\n```\nimport unittest\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n\n    def test_ray_function(self):\n        # Define a Ray function\n        @ray.remote\n        def my_function(x):\n            return x + 1\n\n        # Call the Ray function\n        result = my_function.remote(1)\n\n        # Assert that the result is correct\n        assert result == 2\n```\nIn this example, we define a Ray function `my_function` that takes an integer `x` and returns `x + 1`. We then call the function using `my_function.remote(1)` and assert that the result is `2`.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.task` function to test Ray tasks. Here's an example:\n```\nimport unittest\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n\n    def test_ray_task(self):\n        # Define a Ray task\n        @ray.task\n        def my_task(x):\n            return x + 1\n\n        # Call the Ray task\n        result = my_task.remote(1)\n\n        # Assert that the result is correct\n        assert result == 2\n```\nIn this example, we define a Ray task `my_task` that takes an integer `x` and returns `x + 1`. We then call the task using `my_task.remote(1)` and assert that the result is `2`.\n\nNote that these are just examples, and you will need to modify them to fit your specific use case. Additionally, you may need to use other testing frameworks or libraries to test your Ray code, depending on your specific needs.",

Install the required packages: `pip install \"ray[serve]\" requests torch diffusers==0.12.1 transformers`\n2. Save the following code to a file named `stable_diffusion.py`:\n```python\nfrom io import BytesIO\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\nfrom fastapi.responses import Response\n\n@serve.deployment(\n    ray_actor_options={\"num_gpus\": 1},\n    autoscaling_config={\"min_replicas\": 0, \"max_replicas\": 2},\n)\nclass StableDiffusionV2:\n    def __init__(self):\n        from diffusers import EulerDiscreteScheduler, StableDiffusionPipeline\n\n        model_id = \"stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2\"\n\nentrypoint = APIIngress.bind(StableDiffusionV2.bind())\n```\n3. Use `serve run stable_diffusion:entrypoint` to start the serve application.\n\nNote: The autoscaling config sets `min_replicas` to 0, which means the deployment starts with no ObjectDetection replicas. These replicas spawn only when a request arrives. When no requests arrive after a certain period, Serve downscales ObjectDetection back to 0 replica to save GPU resources.\n\nThese messages are expected in the output:\n\n* `INFO:root:Starting Ray Serve application with 0 replicas.`\n* `INFO:root:Starting Ray Serve application with 1 replicas.`\n* `INFO:root:Starting Ray Serve application with 2 replicas.`\n* `INFO:root:Starting Ray Serve application with 0 replicas.`\n\nYou can develop Ray Serve on your laptop, deploy it on a dev box, and scale it out to multiple machines or a Kubernetes cluster, all with minimal or no changes to code. It\u2019s a lot easier to get started with when you don\u2019t need to provision and manage a K8s cluster. When it\u2019s time to deploy, you can use our Kubernetes Operator to transparently deploy your Ray Serve application to K8s.",

            "answer": " Ray supports async.io by using the `asyncio` module in Python. With Ray, every remote operation is asynchronous, meaning it returns a promise/future that represents the result of the operation. The programmer can then use `ray.get()` to retrieve the actual results, which blocks until the results are available. Ray also integrates with popular async frameworks like `aiohttp` and `aioredis`.\n\nTo define an async actor in Ray, the `async` keyword is used before the method definition. Ray will automatically detect whether an actor supports async calls or not.\n\nWhen running async actor tasks, Ray seeks to cancel the associated `asyncio.Task` when the task is interrupted. This cancellation approach aligns with the standards presented in `asyncio` task cancellation. Note that `asyncio.Task` won\u2019t be interrupted in the middle of execution if you don\u2019t `await` within the async function.\n\nIn summary, Ray supports async.io by using the `asyncio` module and integrating with popular async frameworks. Async actors are defined using the `async` keyword before the method definition, and Ray seeks to cancel the associated `asyncio.Task` when the task is interrupted.",

We then create an instance of the actor using `Actor.remote()` and call the `log` method on it using `ray.get(actor.log.remote(\"A log message for an actor.\"))`. The log message will be printed to stdout.\n\nYou can also customize the prefixes for Actor logs by defining the `__repr__` method for the Actor class.

The directory can be a local directory or a remote URI to a .zip file (S3, GS, HTTP).\n\nFor example:\n```\nray job submit --working-dir your_working_directory -- python script.py\n```\nThis command will run the script on the Ray Cluster and wait until the job has finished. Note that it also streams the stdout of the job back to the client (hello world in this case). Ray will also make the contents of the directory passed as `--working-dir` available to the Ray job by downloading the directory to all nodes in your cluster.\n\nAlternatively, you can set the `RAY_WORKING_DIR` environment variable to the path of the working directory. This will make the working directory available to all Ray tasks and actors in the code without any code changes.\n\nNote that the behavior of changing the working directory can be disabled by setting the `RAY_CHDIR_TO_TRIAL_DIR=0` environment variable. This allows access to files in the original working directory, but relative paths should be used for read-only purposes, and you must make sure that the directory is synced on all nodes if running on multiple machines.",

For example, to request 3 GPUs, you can use the following code:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Connect to the Ray cluster\nray.init(\"ray://<head_node_host>:<port>\")\n\n# Request 3 GPUs\nray.autoscaler.sdk.request_resources(bundles=[{\"GPU\": 3}])\n```\nThis will request 3 GPUs from the Ray cluster, and the cluster will immediately attempt to scale up to accommodate the requested resources.",

You can specify multiple subnets by separating them with commas.\n\nNote that the `subnets` field is only available in the `provider` section of the configuration file, and it is not available in the `cluster` section.

Check the Ray cluster logs to see if there are any error messages related to the pending nodes. You can use the `ray logs` command to view the logs.\n3. Check the system settings on the nodes to ensure that they are properly configured for communication. You can use the `ray system-config` command to view the system settings.\n4. Check the network connectivity between the nodes to ensure that they can communicate with each other. You can use the `ray network-status` command to view the network status.\n5.

Enable Ray logging by setting the `RAY_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `DEBUG` or `TRACE`. This will log detailed information about the system-level behavior of Ray, including any failures that occur.\n3. Use the `ray.serve.logger` module to log custom messages from within your deployment replicas. This can be useful for debugging application-level issues.\n4. Test your Ray Serve script locally or in a RayCluster before deploying it to a RayService.

This method takes a single integer as input, which indicates the number of rows to take. For example:\n```\nrows = ds.take_batch(5)\n```\nThis will take the first five rows from the dataset and return them as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row.\n\nNote that the `split_at_indices()` method is more flexible than `take_batch()`, as it allows you to specify the exact indices at which to split the dataset. However, `take_batch()` can be more convenient for simple use cases where you just want to take a fixed number of rows from the dataset.",

We then use the `get_checkpoints` method to retrieve all checkpoints for the experiment. Finally, we print the checkpoints to the console.\n\nNote that the `resume_errored` argument is set to `True` to indicate that the experiment should be resumed even if there were errors during the previous run.

The `ray start` command takes the following arguments:\n\n* `--head`: Start the Ray head node.\n* `--port`: Specify the port to use for the Ray head node.\n* `--worker`: Start a Ray worker node.\n* `--address`: Specify the address of the Ray head node.\n\nHere's an example command to start the Ray head node:\n```\n$ ray start --head --port=6379\n```\nThis command will start the Ray head node on the current machine and listen on port 6379.\n\nTo start a Ray worker node, you can use the following command:\n```\n$ ray start --worker --address=<head_node_address>\n```\nReplace `<head_node_address>` with the address of the Ray head node.\n\nNote that you'll need to have Ray installed on each machine in the cluster, and you'll need to configure the nodes to allow incoming connections on the specified port.",

Set `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST` to the IP address of the head node followed by the port number that Prometheus is running on (e.g. `http://<head_node_ip>:9090`).\n\nFor example, if the IP address of the head node is `55.66.77.88` and Grafana is running on port `3000`, you can set `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` to `http://55.66.77.88:3000`. Similarly, if Prometheus is running on port `9090`, you can set `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST` to `http://55.66.77.88:9090`.\n\nIf you are using KubeRay, you can also set `RAY_GRAFANA_IFRAME_HOST` to the external URL of the Grafana ingress.

We then use the `get_log` API to retrieve the log file names available on the dead node. Finally, we print the log file names to the console.\n\nNote that the `list_logs` and `get_log` APIs can also be used to retrieve logs from other nodes in the cluster, not just dead nodes.

Make sure that the worker node is accessible from the head node, and that there are no firewall settings preventing access.\n3. Check the version of Ray running on the head node and ensure that it matches the version running on the worker node.\n4. If the connection fails, you can use a tool such as nmap or nc to check whether each port can be reached from the worker node.\n5. If you are using GCS fault tolerance, ensure that the ray.io/external-storage-namespace annotation is unique for each RayCluster custom resource.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, you may need to provide more information about your Ray cluster configuration and the specific error messages you are seeing in order to troubleshoot the problem further.",

The `no_restart` argument is set to `True` to prevent the replica from being restarted.\n\nNote that killing a replica will cause the replica to be removed from the deployment, and any requests that were being processed by the replica will be lost. If you want to simulate a replica failure without losing requests, you can use the `ray.kill` function with the `no_restart` argument set to `False`. This will cause the replica to be restarted, and any requests that were being processed by the replica will be re-routed to the new replica.",
