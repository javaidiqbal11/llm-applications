The Ray autoscaler, which runs on the head node or as a sidecar container in the head pod if using Kubernetes, increases the number of worker nodes when the resource demands exceed the current capacity of the cluster. It removes idle worker nodes from the cluster. The autoscaler reacts to task and actor resource requests, not application metrics or physical resource utilization. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start replica actors based on request demand. If there aren't enough available CPUs, it requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider. When scaling down, it tries to terminate replica actors in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them. The Ray autoscaler is configured using the Ray cluster launcher and adjusts the number of nodes based on resource demand. It considers logical resource requests for scaling, not physical machine utilization. Autoscaling can reduce workload costs but adds node launch overheads and can be tricky to configure. It is recommended to start with non-autoscaling clusters if new to Ray.",

A deployment consists of replicas, which are individual copies of the class or function that are started in separate Ray Actors. The number of replicas can be scaled up or down to match the incoming request load. To define a deployment, use the @serve.deployment decorator on a Python class or function. The deployment can be configured to scale out by increasing the number of replicas and assign replica resources such as CPUs and GPUs. In Ray Serve 2.0, a new deployment API was released, but the 1.x deployment API can still be used (deprecated in the future version).",

Retrieval: A named actor can be easily retrieved from any job in the Ray cluster, even if the actor handle is not directly passed to the task that needs it or if it was launched by another driver.\n\n2. Garbage collection: The named actor will still be garbage-collected if no handles to it exist, ensuring efficient resource management.\n\n3. Namespace control: Named actors can be assigned to a specific namespace, allowing for better organization and access control within the cluster.\n\n4. Accessibility: Named actors can be accessed and manipulated by their name, making it easier to work with and manage multiple actors within the cluster.",

Create a script that uses Ray APIs to define and execute the task you want to submit. For example:\n```python\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\ndef hello_world():\n    return \"hello world\"\n\nray.init()\nprint(ray.get(hello_world.remote()))\n```\n\n2. Initialize a JobSubmissionClient object by providing the Ray cluster head node address and the port used by the Ray Dashboard (8265 by default). For a local Ray cluster, you can use:\n```python\nfrom ray.job_submission import JobSubmissionClient\n\nclient = JobSubmissionClient(\"http://127.0.0.1:8265\")\n```\n\n3. Submit the job by calling the `submit_job` method of the JobSubmissionClient object. Specify the entrypoint shell command to execute (e.g., \"python script.py\") and the path to the local directory that contains the script.py file. For example:\n```python\njob_id = client.submit_job(\n    entrypoint=\"python script.py\",\n    runtime_env={\"working_dir\": \"./\"}\n)\n```\n\n4. The `submit_job` call will return immediately with the job ID. You can print the job ID if needed:\n```python\nprint(job_id)\n```\n\nNote: By default, the Ray job server will generate a new job ID and return it. However, you can also choose a unique job ID string and pass it into `submit_job` if desired.\n\nThat's it! Your job will be submitted and executed by the Ray cluster.",

If there are pending nodes, ensure that your Kubernetes cluster has sufficient resources to accommodate the RayCluster. Insufficient resources can cause the cluster to continuously restart.\n\n3. If the issue persists, you can try restarting the Ray cluster without running any installation commands using the command \"ray up CLUSTER.YAML --restart-only\".\n\n4. If you are using the KubeRay operator, make sure that the Kubernetes cluster has enough resources to accommodate the serve application. Insufficient resources can lead to a loop of restarts.\n\n5. Consider specifying a storage path as part of air.RunConfig to upload results to cloud storage like S3.

The system detects the failure and attempts to respawn the actors on the remaining healthy nodes. The failed node is restarted on another running node, and a new healthy node is brought up to replace it.\n\n3. Actor termination: An actor can be terminated using the `ray.kill` command. When this happens, the actor is marked as dead, and the death cause is recorded.
