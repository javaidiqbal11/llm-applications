It could be that the Dashboard, Dashboard Agent, and GCS are still starting up after the head Pod is ready, as these may take a few seconds. It could also be due to an incorrect address provided when trying to connect to the remote cluster. Make sure you're using the correct format, like `ray.init(address=\"ray://123.45.67.89:10001\")`.

It supports multi-model composition using a programmable API, making calls to different models as simple as function calls. It also allows for flexible scaling and resource allocation. Ray Serve is framework-agnostic, meaning it can serve models built with various frameworks like PyTorch, Tensorflow, and Keras, as well as Scikit-Learn models and arbitrary Python business logic. It is particularly optimized for serving Large Language Models with features like response streaming, dynamic request batching, and multi-node/multi-GPU serving. Ray Serve also supports complex model deployment patterns and can scale to thousands of models in production. As for using containers, while they can be used for deployment, they may not offer the same level of flexibility, scalability, and ease of use as Ray Serve, especially when dealing with complex model compositions and large-scale deployments.",

If you're working with tabular data, you can use Ray Data preprocessors. For instance, you can use the MinMaxScaler preprocessor from Ray Data with Ray Train Trainers by applying them on the dataset before passing the dataset into a Trainer.

Clone the Ray repository and navigate to the example directory: `git clone https://github.com/ray-project/ray.git` and `cd doc/source/templates/05_dreambooth_finetuning`. Install additional dependencies: `pip install -Ur dreambooth/requirements.txt`.\n\n3. Prepare some directories and environment variables: `export DATA_PREFIX=\"/tmp\"` and `export ORIG_MODEL_NAME=\"CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4\"`.\n\n4. Download the `ray-service.stable-diffusion.yaml` file: `curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ray-project/kuberay/master/ray-operator/config/samples/ray-service.stable-diffusion.yaml`.\n\n5. Prepare a sample image file and update the `image_path` in `mobilenet_req.py` to the path of the sample image.\n\n6. Send a request to the Ray Serve application: `python3 mobilenet_req.py`.\n\nRemember to test your Ray Serve script locally or in a RayCluster before deploying it to a RayService.",

First, you need to configure the logging level in the actor's constructor using `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)`. Then, you can create a logging method inside the actor that gets a logger instance and logs a message using `logger.info(msg)`. Here is an example:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n\n    def log(self, msg):\n        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n        logger.info(msg)\n\nactor = Actor.remote()\nray.get(actor.log.remote(\"A log message for an actor.\"))\n```\n\nThis will log the message \"A log message for an actor.\" at the INFO level. The logs can be viewed from the Task and Actor table view by clicking the \u201cLog\u201d button.",

The head node also runs more memory-demanding system components such as the GCS or the dashboard.

However, if you're using Ray Data in conjunction with Ray Tune, you need to ensure there are enough free CPUs for Ray Data to run on.

You can limit the number of concurrent Tune trials with the max_concurrent_trials Tune option to ensure CPU resources are always available for Ray Data execution. Also, Ray usually will not schedule more tasks in parallel than the number of CPUs.

For example, if a task or actor requires GPUs, you can use `@ray.remote(num_gpus=1)`. Ray will then schedule the task or actor to a node that has enough free GPU resources and assign GPUs to the task or actor by setting the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable before running the task or actor code. Here is an example of how to do it:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport ray\n\nray.init(num_gpus=2)\n```\n\nPlease note that Ray supports machines running Apple Silicon such as M1 Macs.

If you are using an HDD, specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. Also, using high performance storage like NVMe SSDs can be beneficial. If necessary, Ray will spill objects to disk, but this comes with a performance penalty as data needs to be written to disk.",
