Use a non-vectorized transformation (e.g., `map`) instead of `map_batches`.\n2. Convert the `pandas` DataFrame to a vectorized format (e.g., a NumPy array) before applying the transformation.\n\nHere's an example of how you can convert the `pandas` DataFrame to a NumPy array:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Convert the pandas DataFrame to a NumPy array\ndata = np.array(df)\n\n# Apply the transformation to the NumPy array\ndata = data.map_batches(lambda x: x + 4, batch_size=2)\n```\nAlternatively, you can use the `ray.data.from_pandas` function to create a `ray.data.Dataset` from the `pandas` DataFrame, and then apply the transformation to the dataset.\n```python\nimport ray.data\n\n# Create a ray.data.Dataset from the pandas DataFrame\nds = ray.data.from_pandas(df)\n\n# Apply the transformation to the dataset\nds = ds.map_batches(lambda x: x + 4, batch_size=2)\n```",

This can be useful when you have a large number of actors and want to distribute them evenly across the cluster.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `SPREAD` strategy to scatter actors across a cluster:\n```\n@ray.remote(scheduling_strategy=\"SPREAD\")\ndef spread_func() -> None:\n    pass\n\n# Spread actors across the cluster.\nactors = [spread_func.remote() for _ in range(10)]\n```\nIn this example, the `spread_func` function is decorated with the `scheduling_strategy=\"SPREAD\"` parameter, which tells Ray to spread the actors across available nodes in the cluster. The `actors` list is then created by calling the `spread_func.remote()` method 10 times, which will create 10 actors that are spread across the cluster.\n\nNote that the `SPREAD` strategy is just one of several strategies available in Ray. You can also use the `PACK` strategy to pack actors into a single node, or the `AUTO` strategy to let Ray automatically choose the best strategy based on the available resources.",

Check the logs: Look for any error messages or warnings in the logs that may indicate the cause of the deadlock.\n2. Use the `ray.rllib.evaluation.rollout_worker.RolloutWorker.lock()` method to lock the rollout worker and prevent other threads from accessing it while you are debugging.\n3. Use the `ray.rllib.evaluation.sampler.SyncSampler` class to synchronize the sampling process and ensure that only one thread is accessing the rollout worker at a time.\n4. Check the `ray.rllib.evaluation.collectors.sample_collector.SampleCollector` class to ensure that it is properly configured and that it is not causing any issues with the sampling process.\n5. Check the `ray.rllib.algorithms.pg.pg_tf_policy.PGTF1Policy` class to ensure that it is properly configured and that it is not causing any issues with the sampling process.\n6. Check the `gymnasium` library to ensure that it is properly installed and that it is not causing any issues with the sampling process.\n7. Check the `CartPole-v1` environment to ensure that it is properly configured and that it is not causing any issues with the sampling process.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and fix the issue causing the deadlock in the ray rollout workers.",

You can also check configured system limits with `ulimit -a` for other resource limit errors. For unexpected hangs or performance problems, you can use `ray stack` to dump the stack traces of all Ray workers on the current node, `ray timeline` to dump a timeline visualization of tasks to a file, and `ray memory` to list all object references in the cluster. If you are developing with TensorFlow, it is recommended to use `framework=tf2` and `eager_tracing=True` for maximum performance and support.

The `to_numpy_refs()` method returns a list of two Ray object references, `refs[0]` and `refs[1]`, that point to the two NumPy ndarrays.\n\nTo access the NumPy ndarrays without copying them, you can use the `ray.get()` function to retrieve the NumPy ndarrays from the Ray object references. The `ray.get()` function returns a copy of the NumPy ndarray, so you can modify the array without affecting the original data.\n\nNote that the `to_numpy_refs()` method only works for datasets that can be converted to NumPy ndarrays.

The trial will be retried until it succeeds or the maximum number of retries is reached.\n\nYou can also use the `Tune.with_resources` method to specify the resources for the trial and the `Tune.Tuner` class to define the trial space.\n\nHere is an example:\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray.tune import Tune\n\n# Define the trial function\ndef trial_fn(config):\n    # Your trial code here\n    pass\n\n# Define the trial space\ntrial_space = {\n    \"param1\": tune.choice([1, 2, 3]),\n    \"param2\": tune.choice([4, 5, 6])\n}\n\n# Run the trial with Tune\ntuner = Tune.Tuner(trial_fn, trial_space)\ntuner.fit()\n```\nThis will run the trial with the specified configuration and retry it if it fails. The trial will be retried until it succeeds or the maximum number of retries is reached.\n\nYou can also use the `Tune.Callback` class to define a callback function that will be called when a trial fails.

This can happen if the function is too complex or if it contains large objects that cannot be serialized.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can try the following:\n\n1. Simplify the function: Try to simplify the function by reducing its complexity or removing any unnecessary parts. This can help reduce the size of the function and make it easier to serialize.\n2. Use a smaller actor: If the function is too large to be serialized, you may need to use a smaller actor. You can do this by creating a new actor with a smaller memory limit using the `options` method. For example:\n```\nactor = Actor.options(memory=1000 * 1024 * 1024).remote()\n```\nThis will create a new actor with a memory limit of 1GB.\n\n3. Use a different serialization method: If the function is still too large to be serialized, you may need to use a different serialization method. For example, you can use the `pickle` module to serialize the function instead of the default `ray` serialization method.\n```\nimport pickle\n\n# Serialize the function using pickle\nserialized_fn = pickle.dumps(fn)\n\n# Deserialize the function using pickle\ndeserialized_fn = pickle.loads(serialized_fn)\n```\nThis will serialize the function using the `pickle` module instead of the default `ray` serialization method.\n\n4. Use a different actor pool: If the function is still too large to be serialized, you may need to use a different actor pool. For example, you can use the `ray.util.actor_pool.ActorPool` class to create an actor pool with a larger memory limit.\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray.util.actor_pool import ActorPool\n\n# Create an actor pool with a larger memory limit\nactor_pool = ActorPool(num_actors=4, memory=1000 * 1024 * 1024)\n\n# Create an actor using the actor pool\nactor = actor_pool.create_actor(fn)\n```\nThis will create an actor pool with a memory limit of 1GB and create an actor using the `fn` function.\n\nBy trying these different approaches, you should be able to resolve the \"The actor ImplicitFunc is too large\" error and successfully create an actor with a large function.",

This allows you to scale out the preprocessing to utilize all the resources in your Ray cluster.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use Ray Data to preprocess a dataset of images:\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray.data.preprocessors import MinMaxScaler\nfrom ray.train.xgboost import XGBoostTrainer\nfrom ray.train import ScalingConfig\n\n# Load the dataset\nds = ray.data.read_parquet(\"data.parquet\")\n\n# Preprocess the data\ntransformed_ds = ds.map(preprocess_image)\n\n# Train the model\ntrainer = XGBoostTrainer(num_workers=4, scaling_config=ScalingConfig(use_gpu=True))\ntrainer.fit(transformed_ds)\n```\nIn this example, the `preprocess_image` function is applied to each image in the dataset using the `map` method. This function can perform any preprocessing operations that you want to apply to the data, such as resizing the images or normalizing the pixel values.\n\nOnce the data has been preprocessed, you can use the `fit` method of the `XGBoostTrainer` to train the model on the preprocessed data.\n\nNote that if the preprocessed data is small enough to fit in Ray object store memory (by default this is 30% of total cluster RAM), you can materialize the preprocessed dataset in Ray\u2019s built-in object store by calling `materialize()` on the preprocessed dataset. This method tells Ray Data to compute the entire preprocessed dataset and pin it in the Ray object store memory.

In this case, the function is used to perform batch inference on a dataset, and the `__call__()` method is used to define the logic for this operation.\n\nThe `__call__()` method takes a batch of data items, instead of a single one. In this case, the batch is also a dict that has the \"transformed_image\" key populated by our preprocessing step, and the value is a Numpy array of images represented in np.ndarray format. We reuse the same inferencing logic from step 2.\n\nThe reason for using the `__call__()` method is to make the code more readable and easier to understand. It allows us to define a function that can be used to perform batch inference on a dataset, and it makes the code more modular and reusable.",

We then call the function using `my_function.remote(1)` and assert that the result is `2`.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.task` function to test Ray tasks.

We then call the task using `my_task.remote(1)` and assert that the result is `2`.\n\nNote that these are just examples, and you will need to modify them to fit your specific use case.

Use `serve run stable_diffusion:entrypoint` to start the serve application.\n\nNote: The autoscaling config sets `min_replicas` to 0, which means the deployment starts with no ObjectDetection replicas. These replicas spawn only when a request arrives. When no requests arrive after a certain period, Serve downscales ObjectDetection back to 0 replica to save GPU resources.\n\nThese messages are expected in the output:\n\n* `INFO:root:Starting Ray Serve application with 0 replicas.`\n* `INFO:root:Starting Ray Serve application with 1 replicas.`\n* `INFO:root:Starting Ray Serve application with 2 replicas.`\n* `INFO:root:Starting Ray Serve application with 0 replicas.`\n\nYou can develop Ray Serve on your laptop, deploy it on a dev box, and scale it out to multiple machines or a Kubernetes cluster, all with minimal or no changes to code. It\u2019s a lot easier to get started with when you don\u2019t need to provision and manage a K8s cluster.

            "question": "how to add log inside actor?",
            "generated_answer": " To add logs inside an actor in Ray, you can use the `logging` module in Python. Here's an example:\n```\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Basic config automatically configures logs to\n        # stream to stdout and stderr.\n        # Set the severity to INFO so that info logs are printed to stdout.\n        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n\n    def log(self, msg):\n        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n        logger.info(msg)\n\nactor = Actor.remote()\nray.get(actor.log.remote(\"A log message for an actor.\"))\n```\nIn this example, we define an actor class `Actor` with a `log` method that uses the `logging` module to log a message. We then create an instance of the actor using `Actor.remote()` and call the `log` method on it using `ray.get(actor.log.remote(\"A log message for an actor.\"))`. The log message will be printed to stdout.\n\nYou can also customize the prefixes for Actor logs by defining the `__repr__` method for the Actor class. For example:\n```\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Every memory allocation after `__enter__` method will be tracked.\n        memray.Tracker(\n            \"/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/\"\n            f\"{ray.get_runtime_context().get_actor_id()}_mem_profile.bin\"\n        ).__enter__()\n        self.arr = [bytearray(b\"1\" * 1000000)]\n\n    def append(self):\n        self.arr.append(bytearray(b\"1\" * 1000000))\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"Actor {self.arr}\"\n\na = Actor.remote()\nray.get(a.append.remote())\n```\nIn this example, we define an actor class `Actor` with a `__repr__` method that returns a string representation of the actor. We then create an instance of the actor using `Actor.remote()` and call the `append` method on it using `ray.get(a.append.remote())`. The `__repr__` method will be called to generate a string representation of the actor, which will be included in the log message.",
            "reference_answer": "To add a log inside an actor in Ray, you need to customize the logger configuration when you define the Actor. First, import the necessary modules. Then, initiate a driver using ray.init(). Define your Actor class and within it, set the logging level using logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO). Define a method for logging where you get the logger using logging.getLogger(__name__) and log your message using logger.info(msg).

Load the text data from the S3 bucket into a Ray Dataset.\n2. Preprocess the text data using a custom callable class that sets up and invokes the GPT-2 model.\n3. Use the `map_batches` method to perform inference on the preprocessed data in parallel across multiple GPU workers.\n\nHere's an example code snippet that demonstrates this process:\n```python\nimport ray\nfrom ray.data import read_text\nfrom ray.data.dataset import Dataset\nfrom ray.data.batch_infer import BatchInferModel\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\n# Load the text data from the S3 bucket\nds = read_text(\"s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/this.txt\")\n\n# Preprocess the text data using a custom callable class\nclass TextClassifier(BatchInferModel):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.model = pipeline(\"text-classification\")\n\n    def __call__(self, batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, list]:\n        predictions = self.model(list(batch[\"data\"]), max_length=20, num_return_sequences=1)\n        return {\n            \"predictions\": [prediction[\"generated_text\"] for prediction in predictions]\n        }\n\n# Perform batch inference on the preprocessed data\nds = ds.map_batches(TextClassifier, compute=ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy(size=2))\n```\nIn this example, we first load the text data from the S3 bucket using the `read_text` method. We then preprocess the text data using a custom callable class `TextClassifier` that sets up and invokes the GPT-2 model. Finally, we use the `map_batches` method to perform inference on the preprocessed data in parallel across multiple GPU workers.\n\nNote that this code snippet assumes that you have already installed the necessary dependencies, such as the `transformers` library, and that you have set up your AWS credentials to access the S3 bucket.",

In the `provider` section, you can specify the type of cloud provider you want to use, such as `aws`, and then provide the necessary credentials and configuration for that provider.\n\nFor example, to specify a subnet in the deployment file for an AWS Ray cluster, you can use the following configuration:\n```\nprovider:\n  type: aws\n  region: us-west-2\n  subnets:\n    - subnet-12345678\n    - subnet-87654321\n```\nIn this example, the `subnets` field specifies the subnets that the Ray cluster should use. You can specify multiple subnets by separating them with commas.\n\nNote that the `subnets` field is only available in the `provider` section of the configuration file, and it is not available in the `cluster` section.

This method takes a list of sorted integers as input, which indicate where the dataset should be split. The method returns the dataset splits.\n\nFor example, if you have a Ray Dataset `ds` and you want to split it into two parts, you can use the following code:\n```\nd1, d2 = ds.split_at_indices([2])\n```\nThis will split the dataset into two parts, with the first part containing the first two rows and the second part containing the remaining rows.\n\nYou can also use the `take_batch()` method to take a subset of rows from a Ray Dataset. This method takes a single integer as input, which indicates the number of rows to take. For example:\n```\nrows = ds.take_batch(5)\n```\nThis will take the first five rows from the dataset and return them as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row.\n\nNote that the `split_at_indices()` method is more flexible than `take_batch()`, as it allows you to specify the exact indices at which to split the dataset. However, `take_batch()` can be more convenient for simple use cases where you just want to take a fixed number of rows from the dataset.",
            "reference_answer": "To take a subset of a Ray Dataset, you can use the 'limit' method. This method truncates the dataset to the first 'limit' rows.

We then use the `get_checkpoints` method to retrieve all checkpoints for the experiment. Finally, we print the checkpoints to the console.\n\nNote that the `resume_errored` argument is set to `True` to indicate that the experiment should be resumed even if there were errors during the previous run.

If you want to kill the actor but let pending tasks finish, you can call `actor.__ray_terminate__.remote()` instead to queue a termination task. Any exit handlers installed in the actor will be run in this case.\n\nAlso, note that `ray.kill` will not go through the normal Python `sys.exit` teardown logic, so any exit handlers installed in the actor using `atexit` will not be called.\n\nIn Java, you can use `actorHandle.kill()` to kill a detached actor.

The function should take a batch of data as input and return a batch of data as output. The `batch_format` parameter specifies the format of the batches, and the `zero_copy_batch` parameter specifies whether the function should be provided zero-copy, read-only batches.\n\nHere is an example of using `map_batches` to apply a function to a dataset:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Create a dataset\nds = ray.data.from_items([{\"score\": 1, \"label\": \"a\"}, {\"score\": 2, \"label\": \"b\"}])\n\n# Define a function to apply to the dataset\ndef my_function(batch):\n    # Do something with the batch\n    return batch\n\n# Apply the function to the dataset using map_batches\nds.map_batches(my_function)\n```\nIn this example, the `my_function` function takes a batch of data as input and returns the same batch of data. The `map_batches` method applies this function to each batch in the dataset.\n\nThe `batch_format` parameter can be used to specify the format of the batches. For example, if the batches are in the format `[[{\"score\": 1, \"label\": \"a\"}, {\"score\": 2, \"label\": \"b\"}], ...]`, the `batch_format` parameter should be set to `\"numpy\"`.\n\nThe `zero_copy_batch` parameter can be used to specify whether the function should be provided zero-copy, read-only batches. If this parameter is set to `True`, the function will be provided with a read-only view of the batch data, which can improve performance.

These APIs allow you to retrieve logs from a specific node in the cluster, even if the node is no longer running.\n\nHere's an example of how to use these APIs:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Get the node ID of the dead node\nnode_id = ray.util.state.list_logs(node_id=<DEAD_NODE_ID>)\n\n# Get the log file names available on the dead node\nlog_file_names = ray.util.state.get_log(node_id=node_id)\n\n# Print the log file names\nprint(log_file_names)\n```\nIn this example, we first use the `list_logs` API to get the node ID of the dead node. We then use the `get_log` API to retrieve the log file names available on the dead node. Finally, we print the log file names to the console.\n\nNote that the `list_logs` and `get_log` APIs can also be used to retrieve logs from other nodes in the cluster, not just dead nodes. The `node_id` parameter can be used to specify the ID of the node from which you want to retrieve logs.",

You can collect logs written to a pod\u2019s filesystem using one of two logging strategies: sidecar containers or daemonsets. For sidecar containers, you can process logs by configuring a log-processing sidecar for each Ray pod. Ray containers should be configured to share the /tmp/ray directory with the logging sidecar via a volume mount. For daemonsets, you can collect logs at the Kubernetes node level by deploying a log-processing daemonset onto the Kubernetes cluster\u2019s nodes.

Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones. Tasks or actors that use more than their proportionate share of memory may overload a node and cause issues like OOM.
