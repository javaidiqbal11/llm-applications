It supports multi-model composition using a programmable API, making calls to different models as simple as function calls. It also allows for flexible scaling and resource allocation. Ray Serve is framework-agnostic, meaning it can serve models built with various frameworks like PyTorch, Tensorflow, and Keras, as well as Scikit-Learn models and arbitrary Python business logic. It is particularly optimized for serving Large Language Models with features like response streaming, dynamic request batching, and multi-node/multi-GPU serving. Ray Serve also supports complex model deployment patterns and can scale to thousands of models in production. As for using containers, while they can be used for deployment, they may not offer the same level of flexibility, scalability, and ease of use as Ray Serve, especially when dealing with complex model compositions and large-scale deployments.",

It is built on top of Ray, so it easily scales to many machines and offers flexible scheduling support such as fractional GPUs so you can share resources and serve many machine learning models at low cost.

It provides the compute layer for parallel processing, minimizing the complexity of running distributed individual and end-to-end machine learning workflows. Ray offers scalable libraries for common machine learning tasks, Pythonic distributed computing primitives for scaling Python applications, and integrations with existing tools and infrastructure. It allows data scientists and machine learning practitioners to easily parallelize and distribute ML workloads across multiple nodes and GPUs. For ML platform builders and ML engineers, Ray provides compute abstractions for creating a scalable and robust ML platform, and reduces friction between development and production. For distributed systems engineers, Ray automatically handles key processes like orchestration, scheduling, fault tolerance, and auto-scaling.",

Then, you can create a logging method inside the actor that gets a logger instance and logs a message using `logger.info(msg)`. Here is an example:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n\n    def log(self, msg):\n        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n        logger.info(msg)\n\nactor = Actor.remote()\nray.get(actor.log.remote(\"A log message for an actor.\"))\n```\n\nThis will log the message \"A log message for an actor.\" at the INFO level. The logs can be viewed from the Task and Actor table view by clicking the \u201cLog\u201d button.",

If you're running Ray Serve locally, you can access the dashboard by going to http://localhost:8265 in your browser. Check the Serve page in the Ray dashboard to view important information about your application. If a task on a remote worker or actor fails due to a Python-level exception, Ray wraps the original exception in a RayTaskError and stores this as the task\u2019s return value. This wrapped exception will be thrown to any worker that tries to get the result.",
            "reference_answer": "To track an uncaught exception in Ray Serve, you can leverage Ray's logging system. Ray Serve uses Python\u2019s standard logging module with a logger named 'ray.serve'. By default, logs are emitted from actors both to stderr and on disk on each node at /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/. This includes system-level logs from the Serve controller and proxy as well as access logs and custom user logs produced from within deployment replicas. You can parse these stored logs with a logging stack such as ELK or Loki to be able to search by deployment or replica. Serve supports Log Rotation of these logs through setting the environment variables RAY_ROTATION_MAX_BYTES and RAY_ROTATION_BACKUP_COUNT. To silence the replica-level logs or otherwise configure logging, configure the 'ray.serve' logger inside the deployment constructor.",

Low memory: If a node runs low on memory, tasks running on it may be killed, potentially leading to the node being marked as dead.\n\n3. Worker node failure: When a worker node fails, the actors running on it also fail. This can lead to the node being marked as dead.\n\n4.

If the node is running low on memory, tasks may be killed which can also cause CPU spikes. Additionally, if the object store memory is bottlenecked, adding more CPU-only nodes can increase total cluster object store memory, which can also lead to increased CPU utilization.",
            "reference_answer": "Spikes in node CPU utilization can occur due to the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node. By default, Ray tasks require 1 CPU each and Ray actors require 0 CPU each, so the scheduler limits task concurrency to the available CPUs and actor concurrency to infinite. Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones. Tasks or actors that use more than their proportionate share of memory may overload a node and cause issues like OOM. To manage this, the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node can be reduced by increasing the amount of resources requested by them.",

            "generated_answer": "To avoid objects from getting spilled, you can optimize performance by using an SSD instead of an HDD for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. Also, using high performance storage like NVMe SSDs can be beneficial. If necessary, Ray will spill objects to disk, but this comes with a performance penalty as data needs to be written to disk.",
            "reference_answer": "To avoid objects not getting spilled in Ray, you can configure the directory where objects are spilled to. You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed. To optimize the performance, it is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open). It is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. Spilling to multiple remote storages is also supported.",

It provides a small number of core primitives for building and scaling distributed applications. It enables machine learning engineers and Python developers to scale Python applications and accelerate machine learning workloads. Ray Core can run on a laptop, cluster, cloud, or Kubernetes and is the foundation for Ray AI libraries and third-party integrations.",
            "reference_answer": "Ray Core provides a small number of core primitives for building and scaling distributed applications. It allows you to turn your functions and classes into Ray tasks and actors, and work with Ray objects. You can run functions as remote tasks in the cluster by decorating your function with @ray.remote and calling the function with .remote(). Ray also provides actors to parallelize computation across multiple actor instances. When you instantiate a class that is a Ray actor, Ray will start a remote instance of that class in the cluster. This actor can then execute remote method calls and maintain its own internal state. Ray stores task and actor call results in its distributed object store, returning object references that can be later retrieved.",
