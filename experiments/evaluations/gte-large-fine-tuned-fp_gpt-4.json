The Ray Serve autoscaler asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren't enough available CPUs, it requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider. The Ray autoscaler, which runs on the head node or as a sidecar container in the head pod if using Kubernetes, increases the number of worker nodes when the resource demands exceed the current capacity and removes idle worker nodes from the cluster. When scaling down, Ray Serve tries to terminate replica actors in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, and the Ray autoscaler removes those nodes.",

It also supports flexible scaling and resource allocation across different machines in a cluster. Using containers alone may be limiting and hard to work with for complex model deployment patterns requiring the orchestration of multiple actors. Ray Serve handles both batch and online inference and can scale to thousands of models in production.",

It has several features and performance optimizations for serving Large Language Models such as response streaming, dynamic request batching, multi-node/multi-GPU serving, etc. Ray Serve is particularly well suited for model composition and many model serving, enabling you to build a complex inference service consisting of multiple ML models and business logic all in Python code. It is built on top of Ray, so it easily scales to many machines and offers flexible scheduling support such as fractional GPUs so you can share resources and serve many machine learning models at low cost. While containers can be used for deployment, Ray Serve provides a more comprehensive and flexible solution specifically designed for machine learning models.",

If available, you can profile Ray jobs by clicking on the \"Stack Trace\" or \"CPU Flame Graph\" actions. Refer to the Profiling section for more details.\n\n3. For Ray Jobs, worker logs are always captured in the Ray logging directory, while driver logs are only captured for Ray Jobs submitted via the Jobs API. You can find the captured driver logs using the Dashboard UI, CLI (using the `ray job logs` command), or the Python SDK (`JobSubmissionClient.get_logs()` or `JobSubmissionClient.tail_job_logs()`).\n\n4. Ray client logs can be found at `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs` on the head node.\n\n5. You can query the logs of the job using the command: `ray job logs raysubmit_seQk3L4nYWcUBwXD`.\n\n6. Additionally, you can check the status of the job using the command: `ray job status raysubmit_seQk3L4nYWcUBwXD`.\n\n7. If needed, you can request the job to be stopped using the command: `ray job stop raysubmit_seQk3L4nYWcUBwXD`.\n\n8. Log messages include various details such as logging level, timestamp, deployment name, replica tag, request ID, route, file name, and line number. You can find a copy of these logs at `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/`. You can parse these stored logs with a logging stack like ELK or Loki to search by deployment or replica.\n\n9.

The 'apply_reduce' function is used in the reduce phase of the MapReduce process, where the j-th return value from each mapper is sent to the j-th reducer. This is done by passing references to the data using Ray objects, which allows for the handling of large datasets that don\u2019t fit on one machine.

Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones.

You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed. To optimize the performance, it is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open). It is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. Spilling to multiple remote storages is also supported.",

It allows you to turn your functions and classes into Ray tasks and actors, and work with Ray objects. You can run functions as remote tasks in the cluster by decorating your function with @ray.remote and calling the function with .remote(). Ray also provides actors to parallelize computation across multiple actor instances. When you instantiate a class that is a Ray actor, Ray will start a remote instance of that class in the cluster. This actor can then execute remote method calls and maintain its own internal state.
