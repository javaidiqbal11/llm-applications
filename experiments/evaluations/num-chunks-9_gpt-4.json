The Ray Serve autoscaler asks Ray to start replica actors based on request demand. If there aren't enough available CPUs, it requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider. The Ray autoscaler, which runs on the head node or as a sidecar container in the head pod in Kubernetes, adjusts the number of worker nodes in the cluster based on resource demand. The autoscaler reacts to task and actor resource requests, not application metrics or physical resource utilization.",

This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The parameters include min_replicas, initial_replicas, max_replicas, and target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider.

It is built on top of Ray, so it easily scales to many machines and offers flexible scheduling support such as fractional GPUs so you can share resources and serve many machine learning models at low cost.

Check the Ray job logs using the Ray Dashboard UI, CLI (using the `ray job logs` command), or the Python SDK (`JobSubmissionClient.get_logs()` or `JobSubmissionClient.tail_job_logs()`).\n\n2. Use the `ray logs` command to retrieve logs based on filename (cluster) or resource identifiers (actor). For example, you can use `ray logs cluster` to get all the log files available on a node, or `ray logs cluster raylet.out --tail 500` to print the last 500 lines of `raylet.out` on a head node.\n\n3. If the Ray job was submitted via the Job API, you can find the Job logs in the Ray Dashboard. The log file follows the format: `job-driver-<job_submission_id>.log`. However, if the Driver was executed directly on the Head Node or with Ray Client, the Driver logs are not accessible from the Dashboard. In this case, check the terminal or Jupyter Notebook output to view the Driver logs.\n\n4. For Task and Actor logs (Worker logs), you can use the `ray logs` command with the appropriate options. For example, `ray logs actor --id ABC --follow` to follow the log file with an actor ID, or `ray logs task --id <TASK_ID> --err` to get the stderr generated by a task.\n\n5. If you are using Kubernetes with the KubeRay operator, you can check the operator's logs for errors using the command `kubectl logs $KUBERAY_OPERATOR_POD -n $YOUR_NAMESPACE | tee operator-log`. This will redirect the operator's logs to a file called `operator-log`, which you can then search for errors in.\n\nRemember to manage the lifecycle of the logs yourself, as Ray does not provide a native storage solution for log data.",

If these logs do not provide sufficient information, you can then check the system logs.

You can use the user_config field to supply structured configuration for your deployment. You can pass arbitrary JSON serializable objects to the YAML configuration. Serve then applies it to all running and future deployment replicas. The application of user configuration does not restart the replica. This means you can use this field to dynamically adjust model weights and versions without restarting the cluster, adjust traffic splitting percentage for your model composition graph, configure any feature flag, A/B tests, and hyper-parameters for your deployments. To enable the user_config feature, you need to implement a reconfigure method that takes a JSON-serializable object (e.g., a Dictionary, List or String) as its only argument. If the user_config is set when the deployment is created (e.g., in the decorator or the Serve config file), this reconfigure method is called right after the deployment\u2019s __init__ method, and the user_config is passed in as an argument.

This is done by passing references to the data using Ray objects, which allows for the handling of large datasets that don\u2019t fit on one machine.

Read the RayCluster Quickstart guide to understand how to manage and interact with Ray clusters on Kubernetes.\n2. Refer to the RayCluster Configuration guide to learn about the key aspects of Ray cluster configuration on Kubernetes.\n3. Deploy a Ray cluster by creating a RayCluster custom resource (CR) using the command: `kubectl apply -f raycluster.yaml`.\n4. Configure and manage Ray Dashboard to monitor and debug Ray applications and clusters. Refer to the guide for instructions.\n5. Use the RayService CR to define and create Ray clusters and Ray Serve applications using Kubernetes config files.\n6. Use the RayJob CR to define and create Ray clusters and Ray jobs using Kubernetes config files. The cluster can be automatically deleted once the job is finished.\n7. Deploy the Ray cluster by executing the necessary commands. The recommended configuration is one Ray pod per 16-CPU Kubernetes node, but other configurations are possible.\n8. Configure the Ray autoscaler on Kubernetes to automatically scale the cluster based on resource demand. Refer to the KubeRay Autoscaling guide for instructions.\n9. Refer to the Ray documentation for more detailed information on running Ray workloads on Kubernetes, including getting started guides, user guides, and examples.",
            "reference_answer": "To manually configure and manage a Ray cluster on Kubernetes, you need to deploy a static Ray cluster into the default namespace. This can be done by applying a sample Ray Cluster from the Ray repo using the command '! kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ray-project/ray/master/doc/source/cluster/kubernetes/configs/static-ray-cluster.with-fault-tolerance.yaml'. The Ray cluster has fault tolerance enabled by default using the external Redis, and you need to set the Redis IP address in the config. Once the Ray cluster has been deployed, you can view the pods for the head node and worker nodes by running '! kubectl get pods'. Wait for the pods to reach the Running state. If your pods are stuck in the Pending state, you can check for errors via 'kubectl describe pod deployment-ray-head-xxxx-xxxxx' and ensure that your Docker resource limits are set high enough.",

Ensure that the Ray cluster is already started and there is no need to run anything on the worker nodes.\n4. If the program freezes, you can restart the Ray cluster without running any installation commands using the command: `$ ray up CLUSTER.YAML --restart-only`.\n5. Wait for all nodes to start before proceeding. You can use the command `ray kill-random-node tune-default.yaml --hard` to force the trials to continue on a different worker node.\n6. Check if the pods are stuck in the Pending state and verify that Docker resource limits are set high enough.\n7. Consider using larger Ray pods in production scenarios, sizing each Ray pod to take up an entire Kubernetes node.\n8. If running a large Ray cluster with more than 1k nodes, tune system settings to enable communication between the machines.\n9. If using the KubeRay operator, check if the serve application status remains non-RUNNING for an extended period. Insufficient resources in the Kubernetes cluster can cause continuous restarts of the RayCluster.\n\nNote: For more details and specific troubleshooting steps, refer to the provided context.",

Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones. Tasks or actors that use more than their proportionate share of memory may overload a node and cause issues like OOM. To manage this, the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node can be reduced by increasing the amount of resources requested by them.",

If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open).
