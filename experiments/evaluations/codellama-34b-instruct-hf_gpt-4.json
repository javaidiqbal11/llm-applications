The context also provides an example of how to transform batches with tasks using the `increase_brightness` function.\n\nTo answer the query, you could suggest the following:\n\n1. Use the `batch_format` parameter in `map_batches` to specify the desired batch format. For example, if you want to return a dict of NumPy ndarrays, you can set `batch_format=\"numpy\"`.\n2. If you want to return a pandas DataFrame, you can set `batch_format=\"pandas\"`.\n3. Make sure that the function you pass to `map_batches` can handle the specified batch format.

This is because the `RolloutWorker` class is not a remote actor, but rather a local class that is used to perform rollouts in parallel using multiple workers.\n\nTo debug why the rollout workers are deadlocking, you can try using the `ray.get()` function with the `timeout` parameter set to a small value, such as 0.1 seconds. This will allow you to detect if any of the rollout workers are taking too long to complete their rollouts.\n\nYou can also try using the `ray.get_profiling_information()` function to get more detailed information about the performance of the rollout workers.

This means you can use this field to dynamically adjust model weights and versions without restarting the cluster, adjust traffic splitting percentage for your model composition graph, configure any feature flag, A/B tests, and hyper-parameters for your deployments. To enable the user_config feature, you need to implement a reconfigure method that takes a JSON-serializable object (e.g., a Dictionary, List or String) as its only argument.

This will allow you to scale out the preprocessing to utilize all the resources in your Ray cluster.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use Ray Data to preprocess a dataset of images:\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray.data.preprocessors import MinMaxScaler\nfrom ray.train.xgboost import XGBoostTrainer\nfrom ray.train import ScalingConfig\n\n# Load the dataset\nds = ray.data.read_parquet(\"data.parquet\")\n\n# Preprocess the dataset\ntransformed_ds = ds.map(preprocess_image)\n\n# Train a model on the preprocessed dataset\ntrainer = XGBoostTrainer(num_boost_round=10, scaling_config=ScalingConfig(num_workers=4))\ntrainer.fit(transformed_ds)\n```\nIn this example, the `preprocess_image` function is applied to each image in the dataset using the `map` method. This function should perform the desired preprocessing operations on the image, such as resizing or normalizing the pixel values. The resulting preprocessed dataset is then passed to the `XGBoostTrainer` to train a model on it.\n\nNote that the `map` method is lazy, meaning that it won't perform the preprocessing until the results are consumed. This allows you to scale out the preprocessing to utilize all the resources in your Ray cluster.",

This performs an all-reduce operation on the data stored in the actors' buffers, and the result is stored in the buffers of the actors.\n\nNote that the `col.allreduce()` method is a blocking operation, meaning that it will wait for all actors in the collective group to complete the operation before returning.",

            "generated_answer": " To write unit tests for Ray code, you can use the `unittest` module in Python. Here's an example of how to write a unit test for a Ray function:\n```\nimport unittest\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n\n    def test_ray_function(self):\n        # Define a Ray function.\n        @ray.remote\n        def my_function(x):\n            return x + 1\n\n        # Call the Ray function and assert the result.\n        result = my_function.remote(1)\n        assert ray.get(result) == 2\n```\nIn this example, we define a Ray function `my_function` that takes an integer `x` and returns `x + 1`. We then call the function using `my_function.remote(1)` and assert that the result is `2`.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.init` function to start a new Ray cluster for each test, as shown in the example above. This is the safest way to ensure that each test is run in isolation and does not interfere with other tests.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `ray.cluster_utils.Cluster` class to create a mini-cluster for testing. This can be useful if you want to test your Ray code in a more realistic environment, but it may be more complex to set up and manage.\n\nIn general, it's a good idea to write unit tests for your Ray code to ensure that it works correctly and to catch any bugs before they become more serious problems.",
            "reference_answer": "To write unit tests for Ray code, you can use the unittest module in Python. You can start a new Ray cluster for each test in the setUp method and shut it down in the tearDown method. However, starting and stopping a Ray cluster can add significant latency. To reduce this, you can share the Ray cluster across tests by initializing it in the setUpClass method and shutting it down in the tearDownClass method. Be aware that there are certain cases where it may be unsafe to reuse a Ray cluster across tests, such as if your application depends on setting environment variables per process or if your remote actor/task sets any sort of process-level global variables.",

To get the actual results, the programmer needs to call `ray.get()` on the IDs of the results. This call blocks until the results are available.\n\nRay also integrates with asyncio, allowing for the use of async/await syntax. This allows for concurrent code to be written using the async/await syntax.\n\nIn async actors, only one task can be running at any point in time (though tasks can be multi-plexed). There will be only one thread in AsyncActor! See Threaded Actors if you want a threadpool.\n\nFor tasks classified as async Actors, Ray seeks to cancel the associated asyncio.Task.

The arguments are the same as those that can be passed to `ray.remote`.\n\nHere is an example of how to create an actor instance with parameters in Ray:\n```\n@ray.remote\nclass Counter:\n    def __init__(self, initial_value):\n        self.value = initial_value\n\n# Create an actor with an initial value of 10\ncounter = Counter.options(initial_value=10).remote()\n```\nIn this example, the `Counter` class takes an `initial_value` parameter in its constructor. The `options()` method is used to set the `initial_value` parameter to 10 when creating the actor instance.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.get_actor()` method to retrieve an actor instance by its name.\n```\n# Create an actor with a name\ncounter = Counter.options(name=\"some_name\").remote()\n\n# Retrieve the actor later somewhere\ncounter = ray.get_actor(\"some_name\")\n```\nIn this example, the `Counter` class is created with a name using the `options()` method. Later, the actor instance is retrieved using the `ray.get_actor()` method and the name of the actor.\n\nNote that using class variables to manage state between instances of the same class is not supported in Ray. Each actor instance is instantiated in its own process, so each actor will have its own copy of the class variables.",

This function commands the autoscaler to scale the cluster up to a desired size. The cluster will immediately attempt to scale to accommodate the requested resources, bypassing normal upscaling speed constraints. You can specify the number of CPUs you want to be available using the num_cpus parameter, or you can specify a set of resource shapes using the bundles parameter. For example, to request 1000 CPUs, you would use the command request_resources(num_cpus=1000). To request 64 CPUs and also fit a 1-GPU/4-CPU task, you would use the command request_resources(num_cpus=64, bundles=[{'GPU': 1, 'CPU': 4}]).",

Check the Ray cluster logs for any error messages or warnings. You can do this by running `ray logs` or by checking the log files in the `ray/logs` directory.\n3. Check the Ray cluster configuration to make sure that it is set up correctly. You can do this by running `ray config` or by checking the `ray.yaml` file in the `ray/config` directory.\n4. If you are using a custom Docker image for your Ray workers, make sure that it is set up correctly and that it is not causing any issues.\n5.

If you are using a custom Ray cluster, make sure that it is set up correctly and that it is not causing any issues.\n7.

In this case, you can try using the `--no-wait` flag to start the cluster without waiting for it to be fully initialized.

For example, to split a dataset into 3 subsets, you can use the following code:\n```\nd1, d2, d3 = ds.split_at_indices([3, 6])\n```\nThis will return three datasets, `d1`, `d2`, and `d3`, where `d1` contains the first 3 rows of `ds`, `d2` contains the next 3 rows, and `d3` contains the last 3 rows.",

This means that the Ray actor is not using any CPU resources, which could explain why the CPU usage is almost 0%.\n\nTo address this issue, you can try limiting the number of concurrent Tune trials with the `max_concurrent_trials` Tune option.

You can use the `--runtime-env-json` option to specify the runtime environment for the script.\n\nHere's an example command that uses the `--runtime-env-json` option:\n```\nserve run --address=ray://<head-node-ip-address>:10001 --runtime-env-json='{\"env_vars\": {\"MY_ENV_VAR\": \"my-value\"}, \"working_dir\": \"./project/src\", \"pip\": [\"requests\", \"chess\"]}' local_dev:graph\n```\nIn this example, the `--runtime-env-json` option is set to a JSON object that specifies the runtime environment for the script. The `env_vars` field sets an environment variable called `MY_ENV_VAR` to the value `my-value`. The `working_dir` field sets the working directory for the script to `./project/src`. Finally, the `pip` field specifies the `requests` and `chess` packages to be installed.\n\nWhen you run this command, Ray will create a new deployment graph with the specified runtime environment and run the `my_script.py` script in it.

These APIs allow you to retrieve logs from a specific node in the cluster, even if the node is no longer running.\n\nHere's an example of how to use these APIs:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Get the node ID of the dead node\nnode_id = ray.util.state.list_nodes()[0]\n\n# List all log files available on the dead node\nray.util.state.list_logs(node_id=node_id)\n\n# Retrieve a specific log file from the dead node\nray.util.state.get_log(node_id=node_id, file_name=\"raylet.out\")\n```\nNote that the `list_logs` and `get_log` APIs can also be used to retrieve logs from a specific node in the cluster, even if the node is still running.",
            "reference_answer": "To access logs for a dead node, you can use log processing tools like Fluent Bit, Vector, Fluentd, Filebeat, and Promtail. Ray writes logs to files in the directory /tmp/ray/session_*/logs on each Ray pod\u2019s file system. You can collect logs written to a pod\u2019s filesystem using one of two logging strategies: sidecar containers or daemonsets. For sidecar containers, you can process logs by configuring a log-processing sidecar for each Ray pod. Ray containers should be configured to share the /tmp/ray directory with the logging sidecar via a volume mount. For daemonsets, you can collect logs at the Kubernetes node level by deploying a log-processing daemonset onto the Kubernetes cluster\u2019s nodes. It is key to mount the Ray container\u2019s /tmp/ray directory to the relevant hostPath.",

Insufficient resources: If the cluster is running low on resources, such as CPU or memory, it can lead to spikes in CPU utilization as nodes compete for available resources.\n2. Preprocessing compute time: Adding more CPU-only nodes can parallelize preprocessing, reducing the time it takes to complete and reducing the load on other nodes.\n3. Object store memory: Adding more CPU-only nodes can increase total cluster object store memory, allowing more data to be buffered in between preprocessing and training stages.\n4. Network bandwidth: The head node may be bottlenecked by outbound bandwidth, leading to spikes in CPU utilization.",
            "reference_answer": "Spikes in node CPU utilization can occur due to the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node. By default, Ray tasks require 1 CPU each and Ray actors require 0 CPU each, so the scheduler limits task concurrency to the available CPUs and actor concurrency to infinite. Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones. Tasks or actors that use more than their proportionate share of memory may overload a node and cause issues like OOM. To manage this, the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node can be reduced by increasing the amount of resources requested by them.",

You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed. To optimize the performance, it is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open).

Ray also provides actors to parallelize computation across multiple actor instances. When you instantiate a class that is a Ray actor, Ray will start a remote instance of that class in the cluster. This actor can then execute remote method calls and maintain its own internal state.
