The Ray autoscaler, which runs on the head node or as a sidecar container in the head pod if using Kubernetes, adjusts the number of worker nodes based on the resource demands of the Ray workload.

The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider.

It supports multi-model composition using a programmable API where calls to different models look just like function calls. Ray Serve also allows models to use different resources and run across different machines in the cluster. Using containers alone may be limiting and hard to work with, whereas Ray Serve provides a more flexible and scalable solution for serving models.",

It has several features and performance optimizations for serving Large Language Models such as response streaming, dynamic request batching, multi-node/multi-GPU serving, etc. Ray Serve is particularly well suited for model composition and many model serving, enabling you to build a complex inference service consisting of multiple ML models and business logic all in Python code. It is built on top of Ray, so it easily scales to many machines and offers flexible scheduling support such as fractional GPUs so you can share resources and serve many machine learning models at low cost. While containers can be used for deployment, Ray Serve provides a more comprehensive and flexible solution specifically designed for machine learning models.",

You can use the user_config field to supply structured configuration for your deployment. You can pass arbitrary JSON serializable objects to the YAML configuration. Serve then applies it to all running and future deployment replicas. The application of user configuration does not restart the replica. This means you can use this field to dynamically adjust model weights and versions without restarting the cluster, adjust traffic splitting percentage for your model composition graph, configure any feature flag, A/B tests, and hyper-parameters for your deployments. To enable the user_config feature, you need to implement a reconfigure method that takes a JSON-serializable object (e.g., a Dictionary, List or String) as its only argument. If the user_config is set when the deployment is created (e.g., in the decorator or the Serve config file), this reconfigure method is called right after the deployment\u2019s __init__ method, and the user_config is passed in as an argument. You can also trigger the reconfigure method by updating your Serve config file with a new user_config and reapplying it to your Ray cluster.",

To request 64 CPUs and also fit a 1-GPU/4-CPU task, you would use the command request_resources(num_cpus=64, bundles=[{'GPU': 1, 'CPU': 4}]).",

You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed. To optimize the performance, it is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open). It is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. Spilling to multiple remote storages is also supported.",

Ray Core is the foundation for Ray AI libraries and third-party integrations.",

It allows you to turn your functions and classes into Ray tasks and actors, and work with Ray objects. You can run functions as remote tasks in the cluster by decorating your function with @ray.remote and calling the function with .remote(). Ray also provides actors to parallelize computation across multiple actor instances. When you instantiate a class that is a Ray actor, Ray will start a remote instance of that class in the cluster. This actor can then execute remote method calls and maintain its own internal state. Ray stores task and actor call results in its distributed object store, returning object references that can be later retrieved.",
