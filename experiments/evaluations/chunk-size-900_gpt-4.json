The Ray autoscaler, which runs on the head node or as a sidecar container in the head pod if using Kubernetes, increases the number of worker nodes when the resource demands exceed the current capacity of the cluster. It removes idle worker nodes from the cluster. The autoscaler reacts to task and actor resource requests, not application metrics or physical resource utilization. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start replica actors based on request demand. If there aren't enough available CPUs, it requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider. When scaling down, it tries to terminate replica actors in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them. The Ray autoscaler is configured using the Ray cluster launcher and adjusts the number of nodes based on resource demand. It considers logical resource requests for scaling, not physical machine utilization. Autoscaling can reduce workload costs but adds node launch overheads and can be tricky to configure. It is recommended to start with non-autoscaling clusters if new to Ray.",

It has several features and performance optimizations for serving Large Language Models such as response streaming, dynamic request batching, multi-node/multi-GPU serving, etc. Ray Serve is particularly well suited for model composition and many model serving, enabling you to build a complex inference service consisting of multiple ML models and business logic all in Python code. It is built on top of Ray, so it easily scales to many machines and offers flexible scheduling support such as fractional GPUs so you can share resources and serve many machine learning models at low cost. While containers can be used for deployment, Ray Serve provides a more comprehensive and flexible solution specifically designed for machine learning models.",

This means you can use this field to dynamically adjust model weights and versions without restarting the cluster, adjust traffic splitting percentage for your model composition graph, configure any feature flag, A/B tests, and hyper-parameters for your deployments. To enable the user_config feature, you need to implement a reconfigure method that takes a JSON-serializable object (e.g., a Dictionary, List or String) as its only argument. If the user_config is set when the deployment is created (e.g., in the decorator or the Serve config file), this reconfigure method is called right after the deployment\u2019s __init__ method, and the user_config is passed in as an argument.

Initialize a JobSubmissionClient object by providing the Ray cluster head node address and the port used by the Ray Dashboard (8265 by default).

Check the output of the command \"ray status\" to see if any nodes are reported as pending. If there are no pending nodes, the issue may lie elsewhere.\n\n2. If there are pending nodes, ensure that your Kubernetes cluster has sufficient resources to accommodate the RayCluster. Insufficient resources can cause the cluster to continuously restart.\n\n3. If the issue persists, you can try restarting the Ray cluster without running any installation commands using the command \"ray up CLUSTER.YAML --restart-only\".\n\n4. If you are using the KubeRay operator, make sure that the Kubernetes cluster has enough resources to accommodate the serve application. Insufficient resources can lead to a loop of restarts.\n\n5. Consider specifying a storage path as part of air.RunConfig to upload results to cloud storage like S3.

You can collect logs written to a pod\u2019s filesystem using one of two logging strategies: sidecar containers or daemonsets. For sidecar containers, you can process logs by configuring a log-processing sidecar for each Ray pod. Ray containers should be configured to share the /tmp/ray directory with the logging sidecar via a volume mount. For daemonsets, you can collect logs at the Kubernetes node level by deploying a log-processing daemonset onto the Kubernetes cluster\u2019s nodes.

The system detects the failure and attempts to respawn the actors on the remaining healthy nodes. The failed node is restarted on another running node, and a new healthy node is brought up to replace it.\n\n3. Actor termination: An actor can be terminated using the `ray.kill` command.

Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones.

By specifying a different directory path, you can control where objects are spilled to. Additionally, you can specify multiple directories for spilling to distribute the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed.",
            "reference_answer": "To avoid objects not getting spilled in Ray, you can configure the directory where objects are spilled to. You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed. To optimize the performance, it is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open). It is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. Spilling to multiple remote storages is also supported.",

Ray Core is the foundation for Ray AI libraries and third-party integrations in the Ray ecosystem.",
            "reference_answer": "Ray Core provides a small number of core primitives for building and scaling distributed applications. It allows you to turn your functions and classes into Ray tasks and actors, and work with Ray objects. You can run functions as remote tasks in the cluster by decorating your function with @ray.remote and calling the function with .remote(). Ray also provides actors to parallelize computation across multiple actor instances. When you instantiate a class that is a Ray actor, Ray will start a remote instance of that class in the cluster. This actor can then execute remote method calls and maintain its own internal state. Ray stores task and actor call results in its distributed object store, returning object references that can be later retrieved.",
