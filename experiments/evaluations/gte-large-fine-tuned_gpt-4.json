The Ray Serve autoscaler asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren't enough available CPUs, it requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider. The Ray autoscaler runs on the head node and increases the number of worker nodes when the resource demands exceed the current capacity. It removes idle worker nodes from the cluster. Ray Serve autoscaling allows the minimum number of replicas to be 0, and the scale-up occurs when traffic is sent. When scaling down, Ray Serve tries to terminate replica actors in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, and the Ray autoscaler removes those nodes.",

It has several features and performance optimizations for serving Large Language Models such as response streaming, dynamic request batching, multi-node/multi-GPU serving, etc. Ray Serve is particularly well suited for model composition and many model serving, enabling you to build a complex inference service consisting of multiple ML models and business logic all in Python code. It is built on top of Ray, so it easily scales to many machines and offers flexible scheduling support such as fractional GPUs so you can share resources and serve many machine learning models at low cost. While containers can be used for deployment, Ray Serve provides a more comprehensive and flexible solution specifically designed for machine learning models.",

This means that operations immediately return a promise/future, which is an identifier of the operation's result.

Ray natively integrates with asyncio, allowing it to be used alongside popular async frameworks like aiohttp and aioredis. Ray also supports async actors, where async method definitions are automatically detected. However, running blocking ray.get or ray.wait inside async actor methods is not allowed, as it will block the execution of the event loop.

            "generated_answer": "To use a callback in the Trainer class, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a custom callback class that inherits from the `Callback` class or `TrainerCallback` class.\n2. Implement the desired callback method, such as `on_train_epoch_end` or `on_trial_result`, depending on your use case.\n3. Inside the callback method, you can access the trainer object and retrieve the necessary metrics using `trainer.callback_metrics`.\n4. Optionally, you can modify or add additional metrics to the `metrics` dictionary.\n5. Use the callback to report the metrics or perform any other desired actions.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nfrom transformers import Trainer, TrainerCallback\n\nclass MyTrainReportCallback(TrainerCallback):\n    def on_train_epoch_end(self, trainer, pl_module):\n        metrics = trainer.callback_metrics\n        metrics = {k: v.item() for k, v in metrics.items()}\n        # Add customized metrics if needed\n        metrics[\"custom_metric\"] = 123\n        # Report metrics or perform other actions\n\ntrainer = Trainer(\n    model=model,\n    args=args,\n    train_dataset=train_dataset,\n    eval_dataset=eval_dataset,\n)\n\n# Add the callback to the trainer\ntrainer.add_callback(MyTrainReportCallback())\n\n# Train the model\ntrainer.train()\n```\n\nNote: The specific implementation of the callback may vary depending on the use case and the desired actions to be performed.",
            "reference_answer": "To use a callback in Trainer, you need to create a class that extends the Callback class from ray.tune. In this class, you can define methods that correspond to different hooks in the training process, such as on_trial_result, on_trial_start, on_trial_error, etc. These methods will be called at the appropriate times during training. For example, the on_trial_result method will be called each time a result is received from a trial. In the provided example, a callback is created that prints a metric each time a result is received. This callback is then passed to the Tuner's run_config.",

Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones.

You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed. To optimize the performance, it is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open). It is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. Spilling to multiple remote storages is also supported.",

Ray Core is the foundation for Ray AI libraries and third-party integrations.",
            "reference_answer": "Ray Core provides a small number of core primitives for building and scaling distributed applications. It allows you to turn your functions and classes into Ray tasks and actors, and work with Ray objects. You can run functions as remote tasks in the cluster by decorating your function with @ray.remote and calling the function with .remote(). Ray also provides actors to parallelize computation across multiple actor instances. When you instantiate a class that is a Ray actor, Ray will start a remote instance of that class in the cluster. This actor can then execute remote method calls and maintain its own internal state. Ray stores task and actor call results in its distributed object store, returning object references that can be later retrieved.",
