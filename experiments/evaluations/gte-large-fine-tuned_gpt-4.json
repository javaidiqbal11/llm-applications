The Ray Serve autoscaler communicates with the Ray Autoscaler to start or terminate replica actors based on request demand. If there are not enough available CPUs, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider. The Ray autoscaler is responsible for scaling the cluster up or down based on resource demand. When the resource demands exceed the current capacity, the autoscaler increases the number of worker nodes, and when worker nodes are idle, it removes them from the cluster.",

This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The parameters include min_replicas, initial_replicas, max_replicas, and target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider.

For example, `ray logs raylet.out -ip 172.31.183.172` or `ray logs raylet.out -ip 10.0.62.231`.\n\n2. Look for any error messages related to memory pressure or out-of-memory (OOM) errors in the raylet logs. These messages will indicate if the worker was killed due to memory issues.\n\n3. Analyze the memory usage of the worker nodes during the training process. Check if the memory allocated by the workers exceeds the available memory on the nodes. You can monitor the memory usage using system monitoring tools or by logging the memory usage within your TensorFlow code.\n\n4. Consider reducing the number of workers or adjusting the batch size to reduce the memory usage per worker. This can help alleviate memory pressure and prevent workers from being killed due to OOM errors.\n\n5. If the memory usage is consistently high and causing workers to be killed, you may need to allocate more memory to the worker nodes or consider using larger instances with more memory.\n\n6. Additionally, ensure that your TensorFlow code is optimized and not unnecessarily consuming excessive memory.

This means you can use this field to dynamically adjust model weights and versions without restarting the cluster, adjust traffic splitting percentage for your model composition graph, configure any feature flag, A/B tests, and hyper-parameters for your deployments. To enable the user_config feature, you need to implement a reconfigure method that takes a JSON-serializable object (e.g., a Dictionary, List or String) as its only argument. If the user_config is set when the deployment is created (e.g., in the decorator or the Serve config file), this reconfigure method is called right after the deployment\u2019s __init__ method, and the user_config is passed in as an argument.

Ray Data is designed for deep learning applications and offers a streaming solution for loading and preprocessing large datasets. It serves as a bridge from storage or ETL pipeline outputs to distributed applications and libraries in Ray. For tabular data, you should use Ray Data preprocessors, while for unstructured data, existing Ray Data operations are recommended.

For sidecar containers, you can process logs by configuring a log-processing sidecar for each Ray pod. Ray containers should be configured to share the /tmp/ray directory with the logging sidecar via a volume mount.

You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed. To optimize the performance, it is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open).

It allows you to turn your functions and classes into Ray tasks and actors, and work with Ray objects. You can run functions as remote tasks in the cluster by decorating your function with @ray.remote and calling the function with .remote(). Ray also provides actors to parallelize computation across multiple actor instances. When you instantiate a class that is a Ray actor, Ray will start a remote instance of that class in the cluster. This actor can then execute remote method calls and maintain its own internal state.
