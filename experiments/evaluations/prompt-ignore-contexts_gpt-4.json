It also mentions that the default batch size of 4096 may be too large for datasets with large rows, and provides an example of how to increase the brightness of images using tasks.\n\nTo answer the query, I would suggest using the `batch_format` parameter in the `map_batches` method to specify the desired batch format. If you want to return a dict of NumPy ndarrays, you can set `batch_format=\"numpy\"`. If you want to return a pandas DataFrame, you can set `batch_format=\"pandas\"`.\n\nAdditionally, you can use tasks to transform batches by calling the `map_batches` method with a function that takes a batch as input and returns a transformed batch.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `batch_format` parameter to return a dict of NumPy ndarrays:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Create a dataset\nds = ray.data.from_numpy(np.ones((10, 100)))\n\n# Map batches with a function that takes a batch as input and returns a transformed batch\ndef assert_batch(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    assert len(batch) == 2\n    return batch\n\n# Specify the batch format as \"numpy\"\nds.map_batches(assert_batch, batch_format=\"numpy\", batch_size=2)\n```\nAnd here's an example of how to use tasks to transform batches:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Create a dataset\nds = ray.data.from_numpy(np.ones((10, 100)))\n\n# Define a function that takes a batch as input and returns a transformed batch\ndef increase_brightness(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    batch[\"image\"] = np.clip(batch[\"image\"] + 4, 0, 255)\n    return batch\n\n# Map batches with the function using tasks\nds.map_batches(increase_brightness)\n```",

Dask is a Python parallel computing library that provides big data collections that mimic the APIs of familiar NumPy and Pandas libraries, allowing those abstractions to represent larger-than-memory data and/or allowing operations on that data to be run on a multi-machine cluster, while also providing automatic data parallelism and smart scheduling.\n\nIn terms of performance, Ray is generally faster than Dask, but Dask provides more advanced data processing capabilities. Spark is also a popular choice for big data analytics and has a large community of users and developers.\n\nIn terms of use cases, Ray is well-suited for production workloads that require fast, fault-tolerant distributed task execution. Dask is well-suited for data analytics and scientific computing workloads that require big data collections and automatic data parallelism. Spark is well-suited for a wide range of big data analytics and machine learning workloads.\n\nIn terms of interoperability, Ray and Dask can be used together using the Dask-on-Ray scheduler, which allows the entire Dask ecosystem to be executed on top of Ray.

You can customize the configuration by providing additional options, such as the number of worker nodes, the instance type, and the autoscaling configuration.\n\nOnce the Ray cluster is created, you can run your Ray application on the cluster by using the `ray.init` function to connect to the cluster and the `ray.run` function to run your application on the cluster.\n\nFor example:\n```\nray.init(address=\"ray://<cluster-name>\")\nray.run(my_function)\n```\nThis will run the `my_function` function on the Ray cluster with the specified address.\n\nNote that you need to have the Ray cluster manager installed on your machine to use the `ray cluster create` command. You can install the Ray cluster manager by running the following command:\n```\npip install ray[cluster]\n```",

One way to do this is by using a library such as Ray Data, which provides a simple and efficient way to perform batch inference with pre-trained models.\n\nTo perform inference with a pre-trained model using Ray Data, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a Ray Dataset from your data. This can be done by mapping a pre-trained model over your data.\n2. Define a Predictor class for inference. This class should initialize the model just once in `__init__` and re-use it for inference across multiple batches.\n3. Use the Predictor class to perform inference on a batch of data. This can be done by calling the `__call__` method on the Predictor class and passing in the batch of data as an argument.\n\nHere is an example of how to perform inference on a batch of data using Ray Data:\n```\n# Step 1: Create a Ray Dataset from in-memory Numpy arrays.\nds = ray.data.from_numpy(np.ones((1, 100)))\n\n# Step 2: Define a Predictor class for inference.\nclass TorchPredictor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Load a dummy neural network.\n        # Set `self.model` to your pre-trained PyTorch model.\n        self.model = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Linear(in_features=100, out_features=1),\n            nn.Sigmoid(),\n        )\n        self.model.eval()\n\n    def __call__(self, batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n        tensor = torch.as_tensor(batch[\"data\"], dtype=torch.float32)\n        with torch.inference_mode():\n            # Get the predictions from the input batch.\n            return {\"output\": self.model(tensor).numpy()}\n\n# Step 3: Perform inference on a batch of data.\npredictor = TorchPredictor()\nbatch = ds.take(1)\noutput = predictor(batch)\nprint(output)\n```\nThis code will perform inference on a batch of data using the pre-trained PyTorch model and Ray Data.

The `cancel` function then calls `make_request` to send a request to the Ray cluster to cancel the task.\n\nTo use this function from the UI, you can call `cancel.bind(request_id)` to create a bound version of the `cancel` function that takes no arguments. You can then call this bound function to cancel the task.\n\nFor example:\n```\nworkflow_task = some_job.bind()\nworkflow.run(workflow_task, workflow_id=\"some_job\")\nworkflow.cancel(workflow_id=\"some_job\")\nassert workflow.get_status(\"some_job\") == workflow.CANCELED\n```\nIn this example, the `some_job` function is decorated with `@ray.remote` to make it a remote function. The `some_job` function is then bound to a workflow task using `some_job.bind()`. The workflow task is then run using `workflow.run`, and the workflow is canceled using `workflow.cancel`. Finally, the status of the workflow is checked using `workflow.get_status` to ensure that it has been canceled.",
            "reference_answer": "To cancel a job from the UI, you need to use the 'ray job stop' command followed by the JOB_ID of the job you want to cancel. For example, 'ray job stop JOB_ID'.

Here's an example of how you can write a unit test for a Ray function:\n```\nimport unittest\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n\n    def test_ray_function(self):\n        # Call the Ray function and assert the result\n        result = ray.task(PyFunction.of(\"ray_serialization\", \"py_return_input\", o.getClass()), o).remote()\n        self.assertEqual(result.get(), o)\n```\nIn this example, we define a `RayTest` class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. We then define a `setUp` method that initializes the Ray cluster with 4 CPUs and 0 GPUs.\n\nWe then define a `test_ray_function` method that calls the `ray.task` function with a Python function and an input object. We then assert that the result of the function is equal to the input object.\n\nYou can run this test using the `unittest` module:\n```\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\nThis will run the `test_ray_function` method and print the results.\n\nNote that this is just a simple example, and you may need to modify it to fit your specific use case.

To reduce this, you can share the Ray cluster across tests by initializing it in the setUpClass method and shutting it down in the tearDownClass method.

This function takes an optional `filters` parameter that allows you to filter the actors by various criteria, such as their state or the type of task they are running.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `list_actors` function to list all actors in the cluster:\n```\nimport ray\n\nray.init()\n\nactors = ray.util.state.list_actors()\n\nfor actor in actors:\n    print(actor)\n```\nThis will print a list of all actors in the cluster, along with their ID, state, and other information.\n\nYou can also use the `filters` parameter to filter the actors by specific criteria. For example, to list all actors that are currently running, you can use the following code:\n```\nimport ray\n\nray.init()\n\nactors = ray.util.state.list_actors(filters=[(\"state\", \"=\", \"RUNNING\")])\n\nfor actor in actors:\n    print(actor)\n```\nThis will print a list of all actors that are currently running, along with their ID and state.\n\nYou can also use the `limit` parameter to limit the number of actors that are returned. For example, to list the first 10 actors in the cluster, you can use the following code:\n```\nimport ray\n\nray.init()\n\nactors = ray.util.state.list_actors(limit=10)\n\nfor actor in actors:\n    print(actor)\n```\nThis will print a list of the first 10 actors in the cluster, along with their ID and state.\n\nI hope this helps!

This means that the Ray actor is not using any CPU resources, which could explain why the CPU usage is almost 0%.\n\nIt's also possible that the Ray actor is not using any CPU resources because it is waiting for other tasks to complete. In this case, the CPU usage would be 0% until the other tasks complete and the Ray actor can resume its work.\n\nTo address this issue, you could try limiting the number of concurrent Ray tasks with the `max_concurrent_trials` option in Ray Tune.

Insufficient resources: If the cluster is running low on resources, such as CPU or memory, it can lead to spikes in CPU utilization as nodes compete for available resources.\n2. Preprocessing compute time: Adding more CPU-only nodes can parallelize preprocessing, reducing the time it takes to complete and reducing the load on other nodes.\n3. Object store memory: Adding more CPU-only nodes can increase total cluster object store memory, allowing more data to be buffered in between preprocessing and training stages.\n4. Autoscaling: If the cluster is set to autoscale, it can lead to spikes in CPU utilization as nodes are added or removed to match the current workload.",
            "reference_answer": "Spikes in node CPU utilization can occur due to the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node. By default, Ray tasks require 1 CPU each and Ray actors require 0 CPU each, so the scheduler limits task concurrency to the available CPUs and actor concurrency to infinite. Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones. Tasks or actors that use more than their proportionate share of memory may overload a node and cause issues like OOM. To manage this, the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node can be reduced by increasing the amount of resources requested by them.",

            "generated_answer": " To avoid objects not getting spilled, you can try the following:\n\n1. Increase the size of the object store: If the object store is too small, objects may not get spilled to external storage. You can increase the size of the object store by setting the `--object-store-memory` flag when starting Ray.\n2. Use an SSD: If you are using an HDD, it is recommended to use an SSD instead, as SSDs are faster and can reduce the performance impact of object spilling.\n3. Increase the buffer size: To reduce the number of IO requests during spilling, you can increase the buffer size by setting the `--spill-buffer-size` flag when starting Ray.\n4. Use multiple remote storages: If you have multiple remote storages available, you can configure Ray to spill objects to multiple storages. This can help distribute the load and improve performance.\n5. Monitor object spilling: You can monitor object spilling by using the `ray.object_spilled()` function to check if objects are being spilled to external storage. If you find that objects are not getting spilled, you can try adjusting the above settings to improve performance.",
            "reference_answer": "To avoid objects not getting spilled in Ray, you can configure the directory where objects are spilled to. You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed. To optimize the performance, it is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open). It is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. Spilling to multiple remote storages is also supported.",

            "reference_answer": "Ray Core provides a small number of core primitives for building and scaling distributed applications. It allows you to turn your functions and classes into Ray tasks and actors, and work with Ray objects. You can run functions as remote tasks in the cluster by decorating your function with @ray.remote and calling the function with .remote(). Ray also provides actors to parallelize computation across multiple actor instances. When you instantiate a class that is a Ray actor, Ray will start a remote instance of that class in the cluster. This actor can then execute remote method calls and maintain its own internal state. Ray stores task and actor call results in its distributed object store, returning object references that can be later retrieved.",
